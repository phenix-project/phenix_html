 Possible reasons for the presence of the reported
 unexpected low or elevated mean intensity in
 a given resolution bin are :
 - missing overloaded or weak reflections
 - suboptimal data processing
 - satellite (ice) crystals
 - NCS
 - translational pseudo symmetry (detected elsewhere)
 - outliers (detected elsewhere)
 - ice rings (detected elsewhere)
 - other problems
 Note that the presence of abnormalities
 in a certain region of reciprocal space might
 confuse the data validation algorithm throughout
 a large region of reciprocal space, even though
 the data is acceptable in those areas.

p(wilson)  : 1-(1-exp[-|E|^2])

p(wilson) is the probability that an E-value of the specified

p(extreme) is the probability that the largest |E| value is
larger or equal than the observed largest |E| value.

Both measures can be used for outlier detection. p(extreme)

 The following statistics were obtained from ice-ring

     ( rms deviation   : 0.00 )

 The following table shows the z-scores

 Large z-scores and high completeness in these

 Abnormalities in mean intensity or completeness at
 resolution ranges with a relative ice ring intensity
 lower then 0.10 will be ignored.

 At 3.67 A there is an lower occupancy

  Even though the completeness is lower as expected,
  the mean intensity is still reasonable at this resolution

 At 3.44 A there is an lower occupancy

 The anomalous signal seems to extend to about 5.9 A
 (or to 5.2 A, from a more optimistic point of view)
 The quoted resolution limits can be used as a guideline
 to decide where to cut the resolution for phenix.hyss
 As the anomalous signal is not very strong in this data set
 substructure solution via SAD might prove to be a challenge.
 Especially if only low resolution reflections are used,
 the resulting substructures could contain a significant amount of
 of false positives.

  1 merohedral twin operators found
  0 pseudo-merohedral twin operators found
In total,   1 twin operator were found

<p>Non-merohedral (reticular) twinning is not considered. The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">R-metric</span></tt> is equal
to :</p>
<blockquote>
Sum (M_i-N_i)^2 / Sum M_i^2</blockquote>
<p>M_i are elements of the original metric tensor and N_i are elements of
the metric tensor after 'idealizing' the unit cell, in compliance with the
restrictions the twin law poses on the lattice if it would be a 'true'
symmetry operator.</p>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">delta</span> <span class="pre">le-Page</span></tt> is the familiar obliquity. The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">delta</span> <span class="pre">Lebedev</span></tt> is
a twin law quality measure developed by A. Lebedev
(Lebedev, Vagin &amp; Murshudov; Acta Cryst. (2006). D62, 83-95.).</p>
<p>Note that for merohedral twin laws, all quality indicators are 0.
For non-merohedral twin laws, this value is larger or equal to zero.
If a twin law is classified as non-merohedral, but has a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">delta</span> <span class="pre">le-page</span></tt>
equal to zero, the twin law is sometimes referred to as a <em>metric merohedral twin

Estimation of twin fraction, while taking into account the
effects of possible NCS parallel to the twin axis.
    Zwart, Read, Grosse-Kunstleve &amp; Adams, to be published.

  A parameters D_ncs will be estimated as a function of resolution,
  together with a global twin fraction.
  D_ncs is an estimate of the correlation coefficient between
  untwinned, error-free, twin related, normalized intensities.
  Large values (0.95) could indicate an incorrect point group.
  Value of D_ncs larger than say, 0.5, could indicate the presence
  of NCS. The twin fraction should be smaller or similar to other
  estimates given elsewhere.

  The refinement can take some time.
  For numerical stability issues, D_ncs is limited between 0 and 0.95.
  The twin fraction is allowed to vary between 0 and 0.45.

Patterson analysis
  - Largest peak height   : 6.089
   (corresponding p value : 6.921e-01)


The largest off-origin peak in the Patterson function is 6.09% of the
height of the origin peak. No significant pseudo-translation is detected.

The results of the L-test indicate that the intensity statistics
behave as expected. No twinning is suspected.
The symmetry of the lattice and intensity however suggests that the
input space group is too low. See the relevant sections of the log
file for more details on your choice of space groups.
As the symmetry is suspected to be incorrect, it is advisable to reconsider
data processing.

The largest off-origin peak in the Patterson function is 7.30% of the

The results of the L-test indicate that the intensity statistics
are significantly different then is expected from good to reasonable,

As there are twin laws possible given the crystal symmetry, twinning could
be the reason for the departure of the intensity statistics from normality.
It might be worthwhile carrying refinement with a twin specific target
