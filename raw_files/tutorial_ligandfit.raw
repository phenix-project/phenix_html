<p>This tutorial describes how to use the <a class="reference" href="ligandfit_gui.htm">LigandFit wizard</a>
to automatically place a ligand structure in a difference map.</p>
<P><H5><U><B>Setup</B></U></H5><P>
<p>The dataset for this tutorial is &quot;N-ethylmaleimide sensitive factor + ATP&quot;,
which can be automatically created as a project in the Phenix GUI.  Three
files are included: a ligand-free model, experimental data (MTZ file), and
the ligand itself.  Once you have creatd the project, open the LigandFit GUI
under the &quot;Ligands&quot; category.  The files can be added to the input list by
dragging them from the desktop, or by clicking the &quot;Add file&quot; button and
selecting them from the browser window.</p>
