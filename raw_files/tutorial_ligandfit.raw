<p><H5><U>Introduction</U></H5></p><p>

 This tutorial will start with experimental data and a model (1J4R.pdb) with ligand
removed (1J4R_no_ligand.pdb) and a randomized ligand conformation (1J4R_random.pdb),
and will fit the ligand into difference density calculated from the experimental data
and partial model.
The tutorial is designed to be read all the way through,
giving pointers for you along the way. Once you have read it all and run
the example data and looked at the output files, you will be in 
a good position to run your own data through LigandFit.

</p><p><H5><U>Setting up to run PHENIX</U></H5></p><p>
If PHENIX is already installed and your environment is all set, then
if you type:
</p><PRE style="face=courier">echo $PHENIX</PRE>
then you should get back something like this:
</p><PRE style="face=courier">/xtal//phenix-1.3b</PRE>
If instead you get:
</p><PRE style="face=courier">PHENIX: undefined variable</PRE>
then you need to set up your PHENIX environment. See the
<a href="install.htm" >PHENIX installation</a> page for 
details of how to do this. 
If you are using the C-shell environment (<b>csh</b>) then all you will need 
to do is add one line to your <b>.cshrc</b> (or equivalent) file that
looks like this:
</p><PRE style="face=courier">source /xtal/phenix-1.3b/phenix_env</PRE>
(except that the path in this statement will be where <b>your</b> PHENIX is
installed). Then the next time you log in <b>$PHENIX</b> will be defined.


</p><p><H5><U>Running the demo 1J4R-ligand data with LigandFit</U></H5></p><p>
To run LigandFit on the demo 1J4R-ligand data, make yourself a <b>tutorials</b>
directory and <b>cd</b> into that directory:
</p><PRE style="face=courier">mkdir tutorials
cd tutorials </PRE>
Now  type the phenix command:
</p><PRE style="face=courier">phenix.run_example --help </PRE>
to list the available examples.  Choosing <b>1J4R-ligand</b> for this
tutorial, you can now use the phenix command:
</p><PRE style="face=courier">phenix.run_example 1J4R-ligand </PRE>
to build the 1J4R-ligand structure with LigandFit. This command will
copy the directory <b>$PHENIX/examples/1J4R-ligand</b>
to your current directory (<b>tutorials</b>) 
and call it <b>tutorials/1J4R-ligand/</b>
. Then it will run LigandFit using the command file 
<b>run.csh</b> 
that is present in this <b>tutorials/1J4R-ligand/</b> directory.
</p><p>This command file <b>run.csh</b> is simple. It says:

</p><PRE style="face=courier"> #!/bin/csh
echo "Running LigandFit on 1J4R data..."
phenix.ligandfit data=1J4R.mtz model=1J4R_no_ligand.pdb ligand=1J4R_random.pdb
</PRE>
The first line (<b>#!/bin/csh</b>) tells the system 
to interpret the remainder of the text in
the file using the C-shell (<b>csh</b>).</p><p>
The command <b>phenix.ligandfit</b> runs the 
command-line version of LigandFit (see 
<a href="ligandfit.htm">Automated Structure Solution using LigandFit</a> for
all the details about LigandFit including a full list of keywords).

</p><p>
The arguments on the command line 
tell LigandFit about the data file  
(<b>data=1J4R.mtz</b>), the model without ligand (<b>moel=1J4R_no_ligand.pdb</b>),
and the ligand (<b>ligand=1J4R_random.pdb</b>).
 (Note that each of these is specified with an <b>=</b> sign, 
and that there are no spaces around the <b>=</b> sign.)

</p><p>The structure factor amplitudes 
are in the datafile <b>1J4R.mtz</b>. This is an <b>mtz</b> file which is a 
binary file that contains summary information about the dataset as well as the
reflection data.
 
</p><p>Although the <b>phenix.run_example 1J4R-ligand</b> command has just run
LigandFit from a script (<b>run.csh</b>), you can run LigandFit yourself from
the command line with the same <b>phenix.ligandfit data= ...</b> command.
You can also run LigandFit from a GUI, or by putting commands in another
type of script file. All these possibilities are described in 
<a href="running-wizards.htm">
Running a Wizard from a GUI, the command-line, or a script</a>.
</p>

</p><p><H5>Where are my files?</H5></p><p>
Once you have started LigandFit or another Wizard, an <b>output directory</b> will
be created in your current (working) directory. The first time you run
LigandFit in this directory, this <b>output directory</b> will be
called <b>LigandFit_run_1_</b> (or <b>LigandFit_run_1_/</b>, where the slash at
the end just indicates that this is a directory).  All of the output
from run <b>1</b> of LigandFit will be in this directory. If you run 
LigandFit again, a new subdirectory called <b>LigandFit_run_2_</b> will be created.
<p>Inside the directory <b>LigandFit_run_1_</b> there will be one or more
temporary directories such as <b>TEMP0</b> created while the Wizard is
running. The files in this temporary directory may be useful sometimes in
figuring out what the Wizard is doing (or not doing!). By default these
directories are emptied when the Wizard finishes (but you can keep their
contents with the command <b>clean_up=False</b> if you want.)
</p>

</p><p><H5>What parameters did I use?</H5></p><p>
Once the LigandFit wizard has started (when run from the command line), a 
<b>parameters file</b>
called <b>ligandfit.eff</b> will be created in your <b>output directory</b>
(e.g., <b>LigandFit_run_1_/ligandfit.eff</b>).  This <b>parameters file</b>
has a header that says what command you used to run LigandFit, and it contains
all the starting values of all parameters for this run (including the 
defaults for all the parameters that you did not set).
</p>
The <b>ligandfit.eff</b> file is good for more than just looking at the
values of parameters, though. If you copy this file to a new one
(for example <b>ligandfit_lores.eff</b>) and edit it to change the values of
some of the parameters (<b>resolution=3.0</b>) then you can re-run
LigandFit with the new values of your parameters like this:
</p><PRE style="face=courier">phenix.ligandfit ligandfit_lores.eff</PRE>
This command will do everything just the same as in your first run but
use only the data to 3.0 A.
</p>

<p><H5><I>Reading the log files for your LigandFit run file</I></H5></p>
<p>
While the LigandFit wizard is running, there are several places you can
look to see what is going on. The most important one is the overall
log file for the LigandFit run. This log file is located in:
</p><PRE style="face=courier">LigandFit_run_1_/LigandFit_run_1_1.log</PRE>
for run <b>1</b> of LigandFit.  (The second <b>1</b> in this log file
name will be incremented if you stop this run in the middle and
restart it with a command like <b>phenix.ligandfit run=1</b>).</p>
<p>
The <b>LigandFit_run_1_1.log</b> file is a running summary of what the
LigandFit Wizard is doing.  Here are a few of the key sections of the log
files produced for the <b>1J4R-ligand</b> SAD dataset.
</p>

<p><H5> Summary of the command-line arguments</H5></p>
<p>  Near the top of the log file 
you will find:

------------------------------------------------------------
Starting LigandFit with the command:

phenix.ligandfit data=1J4R.mtz model=1J4R_no_ligand.pdb   \
ligand=1J4R_random.pdb
</PRE>
<p>This is just a repeat of how you ran LigandFit; you can copy it and paste it 
into the command line to repeat this run.
</p>

<p><H5>Fitting the ligand into difference density with RESOLVE ligand fitting</H5></p>
<p>
The LigandFit Wizard will use the partial model <b>1J4R_no_ligand.pdb</b> to calculate
FC and PHIC (model amplitudes and phases )
for the structure factors in <b>1J4R.mtz</b>. Then these are used to calculate a
simple (FO-FC) exp(iPHIC) difference map which is written to <b>resolve_map.mtz</b>.
</p><p>Then the RESOLVE algorithm for ligand fitting is used to fit your ligand
<b>1J4R_random.pdb</b> into this map. To make the fitting process faster for simple
ligands, the fitting is done in a series of tries, each considering more possible 
rotations of the ligand and each carrying out a more exhaustive search than the
previous one.  Once a fit of the model to the map is found that has a correlation
at least as high as <b>ligand_cc_min</b> (default =0.75), then the process is ended
and the best model is written out.
</p><p> Here is the summary of the first attempt at fitting the 1J4R difference map:
</p><PRE style="face=courier">
Fitting ligand #1 from 1J4R_random.pdb
Ligand file has 45 atoms
Searching for ligand number 1
Estimated ligand volume: 184.0  A**3
Starting CC of ligand as input to map: 0.32
Starting local CC of ligand as input to map: 0.18
USING LOCAL CC: 0.18
Trying fit with n_indiv_tries_min = 5
                n_indiv_tries_max = 10
                n_group_search    = 3
                ligand_file       = 1J4R_random.pdb
USING LOCAL CC: 0.7  instead of std cc ( 0.77 )
Overall score: 128.2533
Atoms placed: 45 of 45
CC to map: 0.7
</PRE>
<p> The log file for the best fit at any time is in 
<b>ligand_fit_1_1.pdb</b> (the first 1 refers to the solution number, 
and the second 1 refers to the ligand number, as you have the option of 
finding more than one ligand in the map with <b>number_of_ligands=n</b>).
This log file will describe the analysis of the ligand and the rigid parts
of the ligand, the search for locations of rigid parts of the ligand, and the
extension of those rigid parts into density to complete the ligand.
</p><p>On this run the parameters <b>n_indiv_tries_min=5</b>  and
<b>n_indiv_tries_max=10</b>  are the
minimum and maximum number of placements of each rigid part of the ligand
to test for completing the ligand. The parameter <b>n_group_search=3</b> 
is the number of different rigid parts of the ligand to try. On 
subsequent tries at fitting these will all be increased to search more
thoroughly.
</p><p>This fitting of the ligand was able to place all 45 atoms in
the ligand, with a correlation to the map in the region of the ligand of
0.70. The &quot;LOCAL CC&quot; is the correlation of the model density
with map density in the region occupied by the ligand itself, plus 
any contiguous points with high difference electron density that are
connected to the region occupied by the ligand. This local CC is more 
useful at discriminating between correct and incorrect models than the
standard correlation (which only includes the region occupied by the
model.)</p>
<p>When the LigandFit run is finished, a brief summary will be printed
at the end of the log file and to the <b>Ligandfit_summary.dat</b> file.
The log file in this case concludes with:
</p><PRE style="face=courier">
SUMMARY:

cc_overall 0.71
run_number 1
starting_cc 0.18
lig_volume 184.0
atoms_placed 45
template 1J4R_random.pdb
number_of_ligands 1
atoms_total 45
model ligand_fit_1_1.pdb

</PRE>
Note that the fit to the map has improved only slightly in this case over 
the initial fit found on the first try. Sometimes this is the case and sometimes
a considerably better fit may be found by searching more thoroughly.



<p><H5>The LigandFit_summary.dat summary file</H5></p>
A quick summary of the results of your LigandFit run is in the
<b>LigandFit_summary.dat</b> file in your output directory.  This file lists the
key files that were produced in your run of LigandFit (all these are in the
output directory) and some of the key statistics for the run, including
the overall correlation between the model and the map and the
number of copies of the ligand placed.  Here is the
summary for this <b>1J4R-ligand</b> ligand-fitting run:
</p><PRE style="face=courier">

</PRE>

<p><H5>How do I know if ligand fitting worked?</H5></p>
<p>Here are some of the things to look for to tell if you have obtained a 
good ligand model:
<UL>
<LI>What is the overall correlation between the ligand and the difference
density map? For a well-fitted ligand this is normally 0.70 or higher.  
Correlations below 0.5 are poor.
</LI>
<LI>How well does the ligand fit the difference density? Have a look at
the ligand and the difference density map in a graphics program. Does the
ligand conformation match the density?  Add the model of the macromolecule now.
Does the ligand make plausible interactions with the macromolecule?
</LI>
</UL>


<p><H5>What to do next</H5></p>
<p>Once you have run LigandFit and have obtained a good ligand model,
you will want to refine the model. Add the model to your PDB file containing
the remainder of the structure and refine the whole structure.  You may need
to define the geometry of your ligand.  In that case the tool 
<a href="elbow.htm">elbow.builder</a>
in the PHENIX package well by most useful (it is quite automatic and generates
all the files you need).</p>
<p>
<p>Once you have fitted your ligand(s), the next thing you might want to do is to re-run the
AutoBuild Wizard, including your ligands with <b>input_lig_file=myligand.pdb</b>.

</p><p>If you do not obtain a good fit of your ligand to the map, there are a 
few things you should check:
<UL>
<LI>Have a careful look at all the output files. Work your way through
the main log file (e.g., <b>LigandFit_run_1_1.log</b>). 
Is there anything 
strange or unusual in any of them that may give you a clue as to
what to try next?  
</LI>
<LI>Have a look at the difference electron density map. Does it have clear
density for the ligand?  If not, you may want to try other types of maps.
You can apply <b>phenix.refine</b> to your data file and your
model without ligand and it will create a map_coeffs.mtz output file that has
sigmaA-weighted map coefficients that should optimally show the placement of 
your ligand. If this map looks better than the <b>resolve_map.mtz</b>, then
you can read in the coefficients like this, where the command <b>lig_map_type=map</b>
tells the wizard to read in the map coefficients directly from the data file:
</p><PRE style="face=courier"> 
phenix.ligandfit data=map_coeffs.mtz lig_map_type=map   \
   model=partial.pdb ligand=side.pdb
</PRE>
</LI>

</UL>
