<p>NOTE: this document is mainly an introduction for users who are not familiar
with AutoSol (or experimental phasing in general), rather than a comprehensive
reference for the program.  The documentation for the <a class="reference" href="autosol.htm">command-line version</a> covers the full range of options and functionality.</p>
<p>AutoSol is an experimental phasing pipeline that combines HySS (Hybrid
Substructure Search) for finding heavy-atom sites, Phaser or SOLVE for
calculating experimental phases, and RESOLVE for density modification and
(optional) model-building.  It will automatically try multiple solutions as
necessary and determine which is most likely to give the desired result;
several different measures of solution quality (discussed below) are supplied.
With good data, a partial model can be obtained for an average-size protein
(30kD) in under an hour, starting only from scaled reflections and a sequence
file.</p>
<p>The examples below mostly use the p9-sad example included in the Phenix
distribution.  If you have not previously performed experimental phasing or
used AutoSol, we recommend setting up a tutorial project in the GUI and running
the full example.  Because these data extend to a relatively high resolution
(1.7A), AutoSol can build a nearly complete model with R-factors well below
0.3, but to save time you may prefer to truncate the resolution at 2.5A,
which will finish in less than 15 minutes.</p>

<p>Most users will have anomalous data from a single crystal (or merged from
multiple similar crystals); although SIR and MIR phasing (with or
without anomalous information) is supported, these types of experiment are
typically done as a last resort.  At a minimum, one reflections file
containing scaled anomalous intensities or amplitudes is required.  Any input
format is supported, and in most cases AutoSol is run immediately after data
processing.  Files can be added to the input list by dragging them into the
main window, or by clicking the &quot;Browse&quot; button and selecting them from a file
dialog.  The GUI will automatically determine the file type, usually assuming
that a SAD or MAD experiment is being performed.  In most cases the data
labels for reflections will be guessed automatically (in the p9-sad example,
only one set of values is available anyway).</p>

<p>You should always supply a sequence file (usually in FASTA format) if you have
this information, although it is optional if you do not perform model-building.
If more than one chain is present, multiple sequences may be specified in a
single file.  At this time, AutoSol (and AutoBuild) can build either protein
or nucleic acid structures, but not both at once.</p>
<p>When you add a reflections file, additional controls will appear for specifying
experiment details such as heavy atom type and number, and anomalous scattering
parameters.  If you are trying to phase using selenomethionine (SeMet),
the number of atoms can be automatically determined from the sequence.  The
wavelength is required; anomalous coefficients (f' and f'') are optional for
SAD but highly recommended.  If you did not record this information at the
beamline using a fluorescence scan, they can be guessed based on the wavelength
by clicking the button below the file list.  For MAD phasing, the
experimentally determined values are more essential, and often make the
difference between an uninterpretable map and an obviously correct solution.
A different example (gene-5-mad, also included in the PHENIX distribution)
using multiple wavelengths is shown below; the inputs are only slightly more
complicated than for SAD.  (In this case the wavelengths and anomalous
coefficients are listed in the file README.txt in the example directory.)</p>

<p>Assuming that the space group and unit cell are automatically extracted from
the reflection files, most of the other parameters can be left on the defaults,
although in the first image above we have changed the resolution to 2.5A.  The
p9-sad example contains only single protein chain in the asymmetric unit so the
number of NCS copies can be left blank, but you should enter this if you are
confident of the crystal contents.  We recommend leaving the model-building on,
since it is the single most useful measure of whether the final map is
interpretable or not.  If you have an RNA or DNA crystal, you may explicitly
set the chain type by clicking the &quot;All parameters&quot; button, select &quot;Crystal
info&quot; from the menu, and change the drop-down menu for &quot;Chain type&quot;.</p>
<p>Two other types of input file are optional but may be useful in special cases:
heavy-atom sites (in PDB format) from an external program such as SHELXD, or
partial phases (in MTZ format) from another phasing program such as AutoMR.
The use of pre-defined sites is not discussed here as it is essentially very
simple, but combination of MR and SAD is described at the end of this
document.</p>

<p>Once you start AutoSol, a new tab is added to the GUI, with multiple sub-tabs
displaying job status and results.  The first tab prints the log output and
summary of the current best statistics for the run once they are available.</p>
<div class="image"><img alt="images/autosol_log.png" src="images/autosol_log.png" /></div>
<p>The second tab displays a list of the most important output files in the job
directory created by AutoSol.  Buttons for viewing the results in graphics
applications will be activated once the necessary files are detected.  The
image below is the appearance of this tab at the end of running the p9-sad
example.</p>

<P><H5><U><B>Xtriage</B></U></H5><P>
<p>The first step in the phasing pipeline is running the data analysis program
<a class="reference" href="xtriage_gui.htm">phenix.xtriage</a>, which identifies potential problems such
as twinning, translational pseudo-symmetry, or weak anomalous signal.
(Xtriage can also be run by itself, starting from the main GUI or the toolbar
button in AutoSol, but you do not need to do this if AutoSol has already run
it for you.)  The graphs and summary text from Xtriage may be viewed by
clicking the button that appears in this section.  We recommend that you read
the <a class="reference" href="xtriage_gui.htm">documentation for the Xtriage GUI</a> for more
information about interpreting the output.  If AutoSol is not successful in
phasing your structure, it is especially important to look over the Xtriage
results before spending more effort on the same data.</p>
<P><H5><U><B>Heavy-atom search</B></U></H5><P>
<p>Within a few minutes, information on heavy-atom site finding will appear in
the third tab.  There may be more than one solution if you are running a MAD
or MIR experiment, but AutoSol will pick the one mostly likely to be correct
for further analysis.  The most important statistic here is the number of
sites located; it will usually be less than the final number of refined sites,
and the difference will be made up in the phasing step.  If the number of
sites is much less than expected, you may not have sufficient anomalous signal
in your data, or (when not using SeMet) the heavy atom may not be bound.</p>
