<p>The electronic Ligand Builder and Optimization Workbench (eLBOW) is the
primary tool for generating non-standard ligand restraints in Phenix.  In
addition to existing as a standalone program, it is also used internally by
the <a class="reference" href="ligandfit_gui.htm">LigandFit wizard</a> and <a class="reference" href="refine_gui.htm">phenix.ready_set</a> (integrated with the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">phenix.refine</span></tt> GUI).  In addition
to eLBOW, a separate standalone <a class="reference" href="reel.htm">graphical restraint editor</a> is
available for advanced customization of restraints and structures.</p>

<p>eLBOW has extremely flexible options for describing ligand information.  The
only mandatory data are some description of the molecular topology, i.e. atomic
composition and (implicit or explicit) bond connectivity.  Four different
sources of information may be used:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>SMILES string</strong>: this is a simplified syntax for uniquely representing
molecules as text strings, invented by <a class="reference" href="http://www.daylight.com">Daylight CIS</a>.  It is often found as part of various
internal or public databases.  This is usually the most reliable form of
information to use, if available.  (You can also provide it as a file,
in the &quot;Chemical file&quot; input.)</li>
<li><strong>Chemical file</strong>: this is either a file containing a single SMILES string,
or  one of a number of different formats, such
as <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.mol</span></tt>, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.sdf</span></tt>, or <a class="reference" href="http://www.tripos.com">TRIPOS</a> MOL2 files,
or some CIF files.  Most of these are at least as good as SMILES strings,
although some CIFs are incomplete and less suitable for use in eLBOW.</li>
<li><strong>Chemical Components code</strong>: this is a three-letter residue code taken
from the <a class="reference" href="http://deposit.pdb.org/cc_dict_tut.html">PDB Chemical Component Dictionary</a>.  We distribute this database
(in CIF format) with PHENIX; for all but a handful of molecules, the
available data include a SMILES string, and often the geometry as well.
If you are using a ligand already present in the PDB and know the code,
this is probably the fastest way to run eLBOW.</li>
<li><strong>Geometry file</strong>: this is usually a PDB file, although other formats are
possible (but discouraged).  Although the geometry file may be useful to
tell eLBOW the expected output structure, it is often less ideal as a
description of topology.  We recommend using one of the other sources of
information as the primary input if possible.  The PDB file does not
necessarily need to be limited to the ligand of interest; use the input
field labeled &quot;Residue selection in PDB file&quot; to select the three-letter
code to use.  (The drop-down menu will automatically be populated with
unrecognized residues.)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Only one source of topology information may be provided, but you may also
provide the geometry file in addition to one of the first three inputs, to
guide eLBOW in constructing the resulting model.  You will need to change the
drop-down menu labeled &quot;Use geometry for:&quot; to one of the other three options
if you do this.  The geometry is especially useful if you already have placed
the ligand in your structure and now need to refine it.</p>
<p>A final source of information is a PDB file containing the template atom
names; the geometry and topology information will be discarded.  If this is
not provided, PHENIX will generate atom names for the output model and CIF
file automatically.</p>

<p>By default, eLBOW will generate a PDB file and a CIF file, suitable for use
in any other PHENIX app (or third-party software).  Additional output formats
are available and may be selected by clicking the &quot;Output. . .&quot; button.
You may also manipulate other details such as chirality, ring pucker, and
PDB file attributes (including ligand code if you are starting from a SMILES
string).</p>

<p>We recommend opening the output CIF file in <a class="reference" href="reel.htm">REEL</a> to make sure
that the results are what you expect.  The CIF may be used in any applications
requiring restraints as input (primarily <a class="reference" href="refine_gui.htm">phenix.refine</a>,
the <a class="reference" href="validation.htm">validation tools</a>, and the <a class="reference" href="autobuild.htm">AutoBuild</a>
and <a class="reference" href="ligandfit_gui.htm">LigandFit</a> wizards).  If you have not already
placed your ligand in the model, the PDB file is suitable for this, but we
recommend trying LigandFit first to save time.</p>
