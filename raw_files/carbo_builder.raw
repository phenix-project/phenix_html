<p>To get to the Carbohydrate Builder, start REEL (cross ref) and use the pull-down
menu to open the builder window.</p>
<div class="image"><img alt="images/carbo_builder_main.png" src="images/carbo_builder_main.png" width="800" /></div>
<p>The toolbar across the top of the window contains the following widgets:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>About button</li>
<li>Buttons for adding common saccharide units including Mannose, Fucose and
NAG.</li>
<li>Open a GlycoCT format file onto the canvas</li>
<li>Add a unit to the canvas using the PDB residue code</li>
<li>Save the polysaccharide on the canvas as a GlycoCT file, PNG, .dot or .ps</li>
<li>Select a grid position system</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The toolbar across the bottom contains the following widgets:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Show/Hide a window displaying the GlyoCT format of the polysaccharide on the canvas.</li>
<li>Enter a SCaLES string to load a new polysaccharide or select from the pop-up
menu of preloaded strings.</li>
<li>SCaLES help (more details <a class="reference" href="scales.htm">here</a>).</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Polysaccharides are displayed on the canvas using a simple design.</p>
<div class="image"><img alt="images/carbo_builder_nag_nag_man.png" src="images/carbo_builder_nag_nag_man.png" width="800" /></div>
<p>One aspect of the display that may cause confusion is the labeling of
the linkage. This confusion is based on the confusing syntax
adopted. The nomenclature β(1-4) or b(1-4) means that the
attaching unit is linking its C1 carbon to the C4 carbon on the other unit via
an oxygen on the β configuration on the attaching carbon. The C1 carbon
is the anomeric carbon in most cases. In some cases, it is the C2 carbon which
means that the link will be β(2-n).</p>
<P><H5><U><B></B></U></H5><P>
<p>When displaying the polysaccharide on a canvas, however, this
distinction is difficult to visualise. The default display layout is
Bottom/Up so the bottom-most unit is usually linked to the protein and
considered the parent unit.
This means that the second index is related to the parent unit while the first
index is related to the attaching or child unit. Clicking on the bond should
clear up this distinction.</p>
<p>As can be deduced from the widgets, sugar units can be added singly or en mass.
Single units are linked to the highlighted unit on the canvas using the default
linkage (beta(1-4))</p>
