<p><H5><U>Introduction</U></H5></p><p>

This tutorial will use some moderately good MAD data (3 wavelengths from 
a gene-5 protein SeMet dataset diffracting to 2.6 A) as an example of how to solve a
MAD dataset with AutoSol. It is designed to be read all the way through,
giving pointers for you along the way. Once you have read it all and run
the example data and looked at the output files, you will be in 
a good position to run your own data through AutoSol.

</p><p><H5><U>Setting up to run PHENIX</U></H5></p><p>
If PHENIX is already installed and your environment is all set, then
if you type:
</p><PRE style="face=courier">echo $PHENIX</PRE>
then you should get back something like this:
</p><PRE style="face=courier">/xtal//phenix-1.3</PRE>
If instead you get:
</p><PRE style="face=courier">PHENIX: undefined variable</PRE>
then you need to set up your PHENIX environment. See the
<a href="install.htm" >PHENIX installation</a> page for 
details of how to do this. 
If you are using the C-shell environment (<b>csh</b>) then all you will need 
to do is add one line to your <b>.cshrc</b> (or equivalent) file that
looks like this:
</p><PRE style="face=courier">source /xtal/phenix-1.3/phenix_env</PRE>
(except that the path in this statement will be where <b>your</b> PHENIX is
installed). Then the next time you log in <b>$PHENIX</b> will be defined.




</p><p><H5><U>Running the demo gene-5 data with AutoSol</U></H5></p><p>
To run AutoSol on the demo gene-5 data, make yourself a <b>tutorials</b>
directory and <b>cd</b> into that directory:
</p><PRE style="face=courier">mkdir tutorials
cd tutorials </PRE>
Now  type the phenix command:
</p><PRE style="face=courier">phenix.run_example --help </PRE>
to list the available examples.  Choosing <b>gene-5-mad</b> for this
tutorial, you can now use the phenix command:
</p><PRE style="face=courier">phenix.run_example gene-5-mad </PRE>
to solve the gene-5 structure with AutoSol. This command will
copy the directory <b>$PHENIX/examples/gene-5-mad</b>
to your current directory (<b>tutorials</b>) 
and call it <b>tutorials/gene-5-mad/</b>
. Then it will run AutoSol using the command file 
<b>run.csh</b> 
that is present in this <b>tutorials/gene-5-mad/</b> directory.
</p><p>This command file <b>run.csh</b> is simple. It says:

</p><PRE style="face=courier">
#!/bin/csh
echo "Running AutoSol on gene-5 protein data..."
phenix.autosol  seq_file=sequence.dat sites=2 atom_type=Se   \
peak.data=peak.sca   peak.f_prime=-3   peak.f_double_prime=4.  \
infl.data=infl.sca   infl.f_prime=-5   infl.f_double_prime=2.  \
high.data=high.sca   high.f_prime=-1.5   high.f_double_prime=3.
</PRE>
The first line (<b>#!/bin/csh</b>) tells the system 
to interpret the remainder of the text in
the file using the C-shell (<b>csh</b>).</p><p>
The command <b>phenix.autosol</b> runs the 
command-line version of AutoSol (see 
<a href="autosol.htm">Automated Structure Solution using AutoSol</a> for
all the details about AutoSol including a full list of keywords).
</p><p>
The arguments on the command line 
tell AutoSol about the sequence file  
(<b>seq_file=sequence.dat</b>), the number of
sites to look for (<b>sites=2</b>), 
and the atom type (<b>atom_type=Se</b>).  (Note that each of these is
specified with an <b>=</b> sign, and that there are no spaces
around the <b>=</b> sign.)
</p><p>For a MAD dataset, we need to tell AutoSol something about the
scattering factors at each wavelength.  The lines like:
</p><PRE style="face=courier">
peak.data=peak.sca   peak.f_prime=-3   peak.f_double_prime=4. 
</PRE>
do this. This line specifies that the datafile for peak data is <b>peak.sca</b>,
that the <b>f&rsquo;</b> value is <b>-3</b>, 
and that the <b>f&quot;</b> value is <b>4</b>. These values will (by default) be
refined by SOLVE prior to calculating phases.

</p><p>Note the backslash &quot;\&quot; at the end of some of the lines in the
<b>phenix.autosol</b> command. This tells the C-shell (which interprets
everything in this file) that the next line is a continuation of the
current line. There must be no characters (not even a space) after
the backslash for this to work.</p>
</p><p>The MAD data to be used to solve the structure is in the datafiles
<b>peak.sca</b>, <b>infl.sca</b> and <b>high.sca</b>
These datafiles  are in
Scalepack premerged format, which means that there is just one  
instance of each reflection and the cell parameters are in the file,
so we do not need to provide the cell parameters or the space group 
(unless the ones in the .sca files are incorrect!)
 
</p><p>The resolution of the data is to about 2.6 A, and we are going
to let AutoSol decide on the best resolution to use for structure
solution.
</p><p>Although the <b>phenix.run_example gene-5-mad</b> command has just run
AutoSol from a script (<b>run.csh</b>), you can run AutoSol yourself from
the command line with the same <b>phenix.autosol seq_file= ...</b> command.
You can also run AutoSol from a GUI, or by putting commands in another
type of script file. All these possibilities are described in 
<a href="running-wizards.htm">
Running a Wizard from a GUI, the command-line, or a script</a>.
</p>

</p><p><H5>Where are my files?</H5></p><p>
Once you have started AutoSol or another Wizard, an <b>output directory</b> will
be created in your current (working) directory. The first time you run
AutoSol in this directory, this <b>output directory</b> will be
called <b>AutoSol_run_1_</b> (or <b>AutoSol_run_1_/</b>, where the slash at
the end just indicates that this is a directory).  All of the output
from run <b>1</b> of AutoSol will be in this directory. If you run 
AutoSol again, a new subdirectory called <b>AutoSol_run_2_</b> will be created.
<p>Inside the directory <b>AutoSol_run_1_</b> there will be one or more
temporary directories such as <b>TEMP0</b> created while the Wizard is
running. The files in this temporary directory may be useful sometimes in
figuring out what the Wizard is doing (or not doing!). By default these
directories are emptied when the Wizard finishes (but you can keep their
contents with the command <b>clean_up=False</b> if you want.)
</p>

</p><p><H5>What parameters did I use?</H5></p><p>
Once the AutoSol wizard has started (when run from the command line), a 
<b>parameters file</b>
called <b>autosol.eff</b> will be created in your <b>output directory</b>
(e.g., <b>AutoSol_run_1_/autosol.eff</b>).  This <b>parameters file</b>
has a header that says what command you used to run AutoSol, and it contains
all the starting values of all parameters for this run (including the 
defaults for all the parameters that you did not set).
</p>
The <b>autosol.eff</b> file is good for more than just looking at the
values of parameters, though. If you copy this file to a new one
(for example <b>autosol_lores.eff</b>) and edit it to change the values of
some of the parameters (<b>resolution=3.0</b>) then you can re-run
AutoSol with the new values of your parameters like this:
</p><PRE style="face=courier">phenix.autosol autosol_lores.eff</PRE>
This command will do everything just the same as in your first run but
use only the data to 3.0 A.
</p>

<p><H5><I>Reading the log files for your AutoSol run file</I></H5></p>
<p>
While the AutoSol wizard is running, there are several places you can
look to see what is going on. The most important one is the overall
log file for the AutoSol run. This log file is located in:
</p><PRE style="face=courier">AutoSol_run_1_/AutoSol_run_1_1.log</PRE>
for run <b>1</b> of AutoSol.  (The second <b>1</b> in this log file
name will be incremented if you stop this run in the middle and
restart it with a command like <b>phenix.autosol run=1</b>).</p>
<p>
The <b>AutoSol_run_1_1.log</b> file is a running summary of what the
AutoSol Wizard is doing.  Here are a few of the key sections of the log
files produced for the <b>gene-5</b> MAD dataset.
</p>

<p><H5> Summary of the command-line arguments</H5></p>
<p>  Near the top of the log file 
you will find:

<p><H5>Running phenix.xtriage</H5></p>
<p>  The AutoSol Wizard automatically 
runs phenix.xtriage on each of your input datafiles to analyze them
for twinning, outliers, translational symmetry, and other special 
conditions that you should be aware of.  You can read more about
xtriage in <a href="xtriage.htm">Data quality assessment 
with phenix.xtriage</a>.  Part of the summary output from xtriage for this
dataset looks like this:
</p><PRE style="face=courier"> 
The largest off-origin peak in the Patterson function is 12.60% of the
height of the origin peak. No significant pseudotranslation is detected.

The results of the L-test indicate that the intensity statistics
behave as expected. No twinning is suspected.
</PRE>

<p><H5>Testing for anisotropy in the data</H5></p>
<p>  The AutoSol Wizard tests
for anisotropy by determining the range of effective anisotropic B values
along the principal lattice directions. If this range is large and the ratio
of the largest to the smallest value is also large then the data are by default
corrected to make the anisotropy small 
(see <a href="autosol.htm#anch26">
Analyzing and scaling the data</a>
in the AutoSol web page for more discussion
of the anisotropy correction). In the <b>gene-5</b> case, the range of
anisotropic B values is small and no correction is made:
</p><PRE style="face=courier">
Range of aniso B:  24.58 27.92
Not using aniso-corrected data files as the range of aniso b  is 
only  3.43  and 'correct_aniso' is not set
</PRE>
Note that if any one of the datafiles in a MAD dataset has a high anisotropy,
then by default all of them will be corrected for anisotropy.

<p><H5>Scaling MAD data and estimating FA values</H5></p>
The AutoSol Wizard uses SOLVE localscaling to scale MAD data.  The procedure is
basically to scale all the data to the most complete dataset, 
ignoring anomalous differences, to create a reference dataset. Then all
F+ and F- observations at all wavelengths are scaled to this reference dataset,
and then the data are merged to the asymmetric unit, averaging duplicate
observations. During this process outliers that deviate from the reference values
by more that <b>ratio_out</b> (default=3)  standard deviations 
(using all data in the appropriate resolution shell to estimate the SD) are rejected.
</p><p>After scaling, the values of  <b>f&rsquo;</b> and <b>f&quot;</b> are
refined based on the relative values of anomalous differences at the various
wavelengths and the relative values of dispersive differences among the 
data at different wavelengths. Then FA values (estimates of the heavy-atom
structure factor) are estimated. These FA values can often be more useful than
the anomalous differences at any of the individual wavelengths because they combine
the anomalous and dispersive information. At the same time as FA values are
calculated, an estimate of the phase difference between the structure factor
of the anomalously-scattering atoms and the structure factor corresponding to
all other atoms can be estimated. This phase difference is useful later in
calculating Fourier maps showing the positions of the anomalously-scattering atoms.

<p><H5>Choosing datafiles with high signal-to-noise</H5></p>
<p>  

For MAD data the AutoSol Wizard analyzes
the correlation of anomalous differences at the various wavelengths.
The anomalous difference for a particular reflection is related to the
f&quot; value at each wavelength. Consequently if the data are good then the
anomalous differences at different wavelengths (but for the same
reflections) are highly correlated. A shell of resolution in which the
anomalous differences have a correlation of about 0.3 or greater has some
useful information. A strong SeMet dataset will have an overall correlation of 0.6-0.7 
for the peak and high energy remote wavelengths.
You can see this analysis in the log file 
<b>dataset_scale_1.log</b> for this MAD dataset:
</p><PRE style="face=courier">

Correlation of anomalous differences at different wavelengths.
(You should probably cut your data off at the resolution where
 this drops below about 0.3. A good dataset has correlation
 between peak and remote of at least 0.7 overall. Data with
 correlations below about 0.5 probably are not contributing much.)

<p>During scaling,

<p><H5>Running HYSS to find the heavy-atom substructure</H5></p>
<p> The HYSS (hybrid substructure
search) procedure for heavy-atom searching uses a combination of a Patterson
search for 2-site solutions with direct methods recycling. The search ends
when the same solution is found beginning with several different starting
points.  The HYSS log files are named after the datafile that they
are based on and the type of differences (ano, iso) that are being used.
In this <b>gene-5</b> MAD dataset, the HYSS logfile is 
<b>peak.sca_ano_1.sca_hyss.log</b>.  The key part of this HYSS log file
is:
</p><PRE style="face=courier">Entering search loop:

p = peaklist index in Patterson map
f = peaklist index in two-site translation function
cc = correlation coefficient after extrapolation scan
r = number of dual-space recycling cycles
cc = final correlation coefficient

Number of matching sites of top 2 structures: 2
Number of matching sites of top 3 structures: 2
p=001 f=000 cc=0.152 r=015 cc=0.278 [ best cc: 0.292 0.285 0.280 0.278 ]

Number of matching sites of top 3 structures: 2
Number of matching sites of top 4 structures: 2

Number of matching sites of top 2 structures: 3
Number of matching sites of top 3 structures: 2
Number of matching sites of top 4 structures: 2
Number of matching sites of top 5 structures: 2

</PRE>
Here a correlation coefficient of 0.5 is very good (0.1 is hopeless,
0.2 is possible, 0.3 is good) and 2 sites were found that matched in
the first two tries. The program continues until 5 structures all have
matching sites, then ends and prints out the final correlations, after
taking the top 2 sites.

<p><H5>Finding the hand and scoring heavy-atom solutions</H5></p>
<p> Normally either hand of the heavy-atom substructure is a possible
solution, and both must be tested by calculating phases and examining the 
electron density map and by carrying out density modification, as they will give 
the same statistics for all heavy-atom analysis and phasing steps. 
Note that in chiral space groups (those that have a 
handedness such as <b>P61</b>, both hands of the <b>space group</b> must 
be tested. 
The AutoSol Wizard will do this for you, inverting the hand
of the heavy-atom substructure and the space group at the same time.
For example, in space group <b>P61</b> the hand of the substructure is
inverted and then it is placed in space group <b>P65</b>.
</p>
<p> The AutoSol Wizard scores heavy-atom solutions based on two criteria 
by default. The first criterion is the skew of the electron density 
in the map (<b>SKEW</b>).  Good values for the skew are anything
greater than 0.1. In a MAD structure determination, the heavy-atom
solution with the correct hand may have a more positive skew than 
the one with the inverse hand. The second criterion is the correlation
of local RMS density (<b>CORR_RMS</b>). This is a measure of 
how contiguous the solvent and non-solvent regions are in the map. (If the
local rms is low at one point and also low at neighboring points, then
the solvent region must be relatively contiguous, and not split up into 
small regions.)
For MAD datasets, SOLVE is used for calculating
phases. For a MAD dataset, a figure of merit of 0.5 is
acceptable, 0.6 is fine and anything above 0.7 is very good.
<p>The first three solutions scored are all quite good.
Here is the third and best one:
</p><PRE style="face=courier">

SCORING SOLUTION 3: Solution 3 using HYSS on FA.sca. Dataset #1, with 2 sites

ESTIMATED MAP CC x 100:  57.6 +/- 14.1

</PRE>
The <b>ESTIMATED MAP CC x 100</b> is an estimate of the quality of
the experimental electron density map (not the density-modified one).
A set of real structures was used to calibrate the range of values of each
score that were obtained for phases with varying quality.  The resulting
probability distributions are used above to estimate the correlation between
the experimental map and an ideal map for this structure. Then all the
estimates are combined to yield an overall Bayesian estimate of the map
quality.  These are reported as CC x 100 +/- 2SD.  These estimated map
CC values are usually fairly close, so if the estimate is 57.6 +/- 14.1 
then you can be confident that your structure is not only solved but that 
you will have a good map when it is density modified.

</p><p>In this case the datasets used to find heavy-atom substructures
were the FA values in <b>FA.sca</b> and the peak data in <b>peak.sca_ano_1.sca</b>.
For each dataset one solution was found, and that solution and its inverse
were scored.  The scores were (skipping extra text below):

</p><p>In this case the best score was using the FA values and taking the
original hand (ESTIMATED MAP CC x 100:  57.6 +/- 14.1), and
score for the inverted hand of the heavy-atom substructure was worse 
(ESTIMATED MAP CC x 100:  39.7 +/- 26.9)
and so the hand was clear.

<p><H5>Finding additional sites by density modification and 
FA heavy-atom Fouriers</H5></p>
<p>When AutoSol is used with the default keyword of <b>thoroughness=thorough</b> as
in this example, additional heavy-atom sites are found by phasing using the 
current model, carrying out density modification to improve the phases, and using
the improved phases along with the FA values and the phase difference between
the heavy atoms and the non-heavy atoms 
to calculate Fourier maps showing the positions of the
anomalously-scattering atoms. The top peaks in these maps are used as trial heavy-atom
sites (if they are not already part of the heavy-atom model.
</p><p>In this example solutions 1, 3, and 6 are all used for this 
phasing/density modification/Fourier procedure. Six new solutions are found, 
the best of which are solution 16, based on a difference Fourier using 
density modified phases from solution 6, 
and solution 8, based on density-modified phases from solution 3. 
Here is solution 16, not substantially different from solution 6 in this case:

which is used for final phasing and density modification.

<p><H5>Final phasing with SOLVE</H5></p>
Once the best heavy-atom solution or solutions are chosen based on 
<b>ESTIMATED MAP CC</b>, these are used in a final round of phasing with
SOLVE (for MAD phasing). The log file from phasing for solution <b>21</b> is in
<b>solve_21.prt</b>. This SOLVE log file repeats the 
correlation analysis of anomalous
differences between data at each wavelength. Then it carries out a 
detailed refinement of the scattering factors at each wavelength. Finally the
heavy-atom model is refined and phases are calculated with Bayesian correlated
MAD phasing. The final occupancies and coordinates are listed at the end:
</p><PRE style="face=courier">
                    SITE  ATOM       OCCUP     X       Y       Z         B

CURRENT VALUES:      2    Se       0.5979  0.9714  0.0088  0.4460   60.0000


</PRE>
In this case the occupancy of one site is 
quite near 1 and the other is lower. The
second site is a selenomethionine that is not well 
ordered (it is the N-terminal 
residue in the protein). </p>

<p><H5>Statistical density modification with RESOLVE</H5></p>
<p>After MAD phases are calculated with SOLVE, the AutoSol Wizard
uses RESOLVE density modification to improve the quality of the
electron density map.  The statistical density modification 
in RESOLVE takes advantage of the flatness of the solvent region
and the expected distribution of electron density in the region
containing the macromolecule, as well as any NCS that can be found
from the heavy-atom substructure. The weighted structure factors and
phases (FWT, PHWT) from SOLVE are used to calculate the starting
map for RESOLVE, and the experimental structure factor amplitudes (FP)
and MAD Hendrickson-Lattman coefficients from SOLVE are used
in the density modification process. The output from RESOLVE for solution 1
can be found in <b>resolve_10.log</b>.  Here are key sections of this
output. </p>
<p>First, the plot of how many points in the &quot;protein&quot; region
of the map have each possible value of electron density. The
plot below is normalized so that a density of zero is the mean of 
the solvent region, and the standard deviation of the density in the
map is 1.0. A perfect map has a lot of points with density slightly less
than zero on this scale (the points between atoms) and a few points
with very high density (the points near atoms), and no points with very
negative density.  Such a map has a very high skew (think 
&quot;skewed off to the right&quot;). This map is good, with a positive
skew, though it is not perfect.

<p>The key statistic from this RESOLVE density modification is the R-factor
for comparison of observed structure factor amplitudes (FP) with those
calculated from the density modification procedure (FC).
In this <b>gene-5</b> MAD phasing the R-factor is very low: 
</p><PRE style="face=courier">
 Overall R-factor for FC vs FP: 0.293 for       2602 reflections
</PRE>
An acceptable value is anything below 0.35; below 0.30 is good.


<p><H5>Generation of FreeR flags</H5></p>
<p>The AutoSol Wizard will create a set of free R flags indicating which 
reflections are not to be used in refinement. By default 5% of reflections
(up to a maximum of 2000)
are reserved for this test set. 
If you want to supply a reflection file <b>hires.mtz</b> that has 
higher resolution than the data used to solve the structure, 
or has a test set already marked,
then you can do this with the keyword <b>input_refinement_file=hires.mtz</b>.

The files to be used for model-building
and refinement are listed in the AutoSol log file:
</p><PRE style="face=courier"> 
Copying  AutoSol_run_1_/solve_21.mtz  and adding free R flags for refinement

THE FILE AutoSol_run_1_/resolve_21.mtz will be used for model-building
</PRE>

<p><H5>Model-building with RESOLVE</H5></p>
<p>The AutoSol Wizard by default uses a very quick method to build just
the secondary structure of your macromolecule.  This is controlled
by the keyword <b>helices_strands_only=True</b>.
The Wizard will guess from your sequence file whether the
structure is protein or RNA or DNA (but you can tell it if you want
with (<b>chain_type=PROTEIN</b>).

<p>If the quick model-building does not build a satisfactory model
(if the correlation of map and model is less than
 <b>acceptable_secondary_structure_cc=0.35</b>), then model-building
is tried again with the standard build procedure,
essentially the same as one cycle of
model-building with the AutoBuild Wizard (see the web page
<a href="autobuild.htm">
Automated Model Building and Rebuilding with AutoBuild</a>,
except that if you specify
<b>thoroughness=quick</b> as we have in this example, the model-building is
done less comprehensively to speed things up.
</p>
<p>In this case the secondary-structure-only
model-building produces an initial model with 32
residues built and side chains assigned to 0, and which has a 
model-map correlation of 0.32.

As the secondary-structure-only model-building does not give a very high

As the model-map correlation is now reasonably good (0.59), the 
model-building is considered successful and the refined initial model 
is written out to <b>refine_9.pdb</b> in
the output directory. It is still just a preliminary model, but it is good
enough to tell that the structure is solved. For full model-building you
will want to go on and use the AutoBuild Wizard

</PRE>
<p><H5>How do I know if I have a good solution?</H5></p>
<p>Here are some of the things to look for to tell if you have obtained a 
correct solution:
<UL>
<LI>How much of the model was built? More than 50% is good, particularly if
you are using the default of helices_strands_only=True.  If less than25% of the model is built, then it may be entirely incorrect. Have a
look at the model. If you see clear sets of parallel or antiparallel strands,
or if you see helices and strands with the expected relationships,
your model is going to be correct. If you see a lot of short fragments
everywhere, your model and solution is going to be incorrect.
How many side-chains were fitted to density? More than 25% is ok,
more than 50% is very good.
</LI>
<LI>What is the R-factor of the model? This only applies if you are building
a full model (not for helices_strands_only=True).
For a solution at moderate to high
resolution (2.5 A or better) the R-factor should be in the low 30's to be very
good. For lower-resolution data, an R-factor in the low 40's is probably
largely correct but the model is not very good.
</LI>
<LI>What was the overall signal-to-noise in the data? Above 1 is good, below 0.5 is very low.
</LI>
<LI>What are the individual CC-BAYES estimates of map correlation
for your top solution? For a good
solution they are all around 50 or more, with 2SD uncertainties that are
about 10-20.
</LI>
<LI>What is the overall "ESTIMATED MAP CC x 100" of your top solution.  This
should also be 50 or more for a good solution. This is an estimate of the
map correlation before density modification, so if you have a lot of solvent
or several NCS-related copies in the asymmetric unit, then lower values may
still give you a good map.
</LI>
<LI>What is the difference in "ESTIMATED MAP CC x 100"
between the top solution and its
inverse? If this is large (more than the 2SD values for each)
 that is a good sign.
</LI>


</UL>


<p><H5>What to do next</H5></p>
<p>Once you have run AutoSol and have obtained a good solution and model,
the next thing to do is to run the AutoBuild Wizard.  If you run it
in the same directory where you ran AutoSol, the AutoBuild Wizard will pick
up where the AutoSol Wizard left off and carry out iterative model-building,
density modification and refinement to improve your model and map. 
See the web page <a href="autobuild.htm">
Automated Model Building and Rebuilding with AutoBuild</a> for details on
how to run AutoBuild.

</p><p>If you do not obtain a good solution, then it's not time to give
up yet. There are a number of standard things to try that may improve the
structure determination. Here are a few that you should always try:
<UL>
<LI>Have a careful look at all the output files. Work your way through
the main log file (e.g., <b>AutoSol_run_1_1.log</b>) and all the
other principal log files  in order beginning with 
scaling (<b>dataset_1_scale.log</b>), then looking at  heavy-atom
searching (<b>FA.sca_hyss.log</b>),  phasing
(e.g., <b>solve_10.log</b> or <b>solve_xx.log</b> depending on
which solution <b>xx</b> was the top solution) and density modification (e.g., 
<b>resolve_xx.log</b>).  Is there anything 
strange or unusual in any of them that may give you a clue as to
what to try next?  For example did the phasing work well (high figure of
merit) yet the density modification failed? (Perhaps the hand is incorrect).
Was the solvent content estimated correctly? (You can specify it yourself
if you want).  What does the xtriage output say? Is there twinning or
strong translational symmetry? Are there problems with reflections near
ice rings? Are there many outlier reflections?
</LI>
<LI>Try a different resolution cutoff.  For example 0.5 A lower resolution than
you tried before.  Often the highest-resolution shells have little useful
information for structure solution (though the data may be useful in
refinement and density modification).
</LI>
<LI>Try a different rejection criterion for outliers. The default is
<b>ratio_out=3.0</b> (toss reflections with delta F more than 3 times the
rms delta F of all reflections in the shell).  Try instead <b>ratio_out=5.0</b>
to keep almost everything.
</LI>
<LI>If the heavy-atom substructure search did not yield plausible
solutions, try searching with HYSS using the command-line interface, and
vary the resolution and number of sites you look for. Can you find a solution
that has a higher <b>CC</b> than the one found in AutoSol? If so, you can
read your solution in to AutoSol with <b>sites_file=my_sites.pdb</b>.
</LI>
<LI>Was an anisotropy correction applied in AutoSol? If there is 
some anisotropy but no correction was applied, you can force AutoSol to 
apply the correction with <b>correct_aniso=True</b>.
</LI>
<LI>Try related space groups. If you are not positive that your space group
is P212121, then try other possibilities with different or no screw axes.
</LI>
