<H5><U>Purpose</U></H5>

Edit the geometry restraints of a ligand using a Graphical User
Interface (GUI) including a 3D view of the ligand and a tabular view
of the restraints.

<H5><U>General Procedure</U></H5>

The general procedure is to load a restraints file (CIF) and
manipulate the restraints via the table or molecule view.  The
geometry of the revised restraints can be tested using the
Action->Geometry optimisation option.  The final restraints can be
saved to a CIF file for use with phenix.refine.  The corresponding PDB
file can also be saved.

<H5><U>Input</U></H5>

Restraints can be loaded into REEL using the command line, the
pull-down menu to open a file and a pull-down menu to run
eLBOW. Restraints files from eLBOW contain both the restraints and
cartesian coordinates.  For the purposes of REEL, the coordinates are
generated by the restraints and can not be edited directly.  The
background colour is light steel blue to show that it is not used in
the geometry editing actions.

<P>

REEL can load a molecule geometry from any format the eLBOW can read,
including PDB, Mol2D and SDF.  If the file does not contain the
bonding information, the bonding is automatically determined using
proximity.  The limit on the size of molecule that the bonding is
automatically determined is set at 200 atoms.

<P>Molecule up to 2000 atoms can be loaded using the --view but only the
bond connectivity is determined.  The bond order is set to one but can
be changed interactively.

<P>Molecules can be loaded into REEL using the --reel option for eLBOW or using
the eLBOW GUI dialog available in REEL.

<P>The Chemical Components database can also be accessed using the --chem 
option so load the cartesian coordinates and atom names of a certain ligand.

<P>The --smiles option will automatically run eLBOW on the SMILES string and
load the CIF file in REEL.

<P>It may be that a CIF without cartesian coordinates is the file to be loaded.
REEL will load it and attempt but its better to provide the cartesian
coordinates.  A simple way is to use:

<PRE><FONT face=courier>phenix.reel ligand.cif ligand.pdb
</FONT></PRE>

and to use the --overlay option to force it in the case of slightly different
ligand details (ligand code).

<H5><U>Editing</U></H5>

The geometry restraints (bonds, angles, dihedrals, planes and chirals)
are the driving coordinates in this editor.  The cartesian coordinates are
displayed in the atoms table only because there are generated for the
viewer display.  They are the driven coordinates and are therefore ignored
if changed in the editor.

<P>Many cells in the table view of the restraints can be changed but care must
be taken to ensure that the changes are local or global.  For example, changing
an atom name in the bonds table view will only change it in that row.  If you
wish to change the name of the atom in all the restraints for should use the
right mouse menu in the viewer window or change it in the atoms table view.
The colour of the cell gives the impression as to whether the changes are
propagated elsewhere.  The cells, in some cases, have not been made read only
to allow the user to make changes as desired.

<P>Clicking an atom in the molecule view will highlight the various
related topological elements in the table view and vice versa.  Use
the checkbox in the table view or a right-mouse pop-menu to remove a
restraint from optimisation and output file.  Chiral centres can be
changed in the table view.

<P>Right clicking in the viewer or in the table view provide pop-menu for
various actions.  Examples are below.

<P>Double clicking the label headers will sort the rows.

<H5><U>Menus</U></H5>

<H6>File</H6>
<img src="images/reel_file_menu.png">

<P>REEL can open a large number of file formats but the best file is the CIF
output from eLBOW.  Using the menu or the shortcut will provide a dialog to 
choose an input file.

<P>The template input allows for the transfer of atom names from a PDB to the
molecule in the viewer

<P><img src="images/reel_cartesian_sub_menu.png">
<P>Two different cartesian options for overlaying onto the molecule in
the viewer are in the "Cartesian coordinate inputs" sub-menu.  The main
difference is the adjustment of the restraints' ideal value from the input
geometry.

<P><img src="images/reel_2d_view.png">
<P>The saving options include a data sheet which is a postscript file including
a two-dimensional representation of the molecule.

<P>The view defaults including the window size and position, the molecular
representation (atom labels and bond view) and background can be managed using 
the "View defaults" menu items. 

<H6>View</H6>
<img src="images/reel_view_menu.png">

<P>View options in include toggling the hydrogens, the background, the
labels on the atoms ...
<P>
<img src="images/reel_atom_sub_menu.png">
<P> and showing the bond orders.
<P>
<img src="images/reel_bond_sub_menu.png">

<P>The listing of the geometry allows the ideal restraint values and the
actual geometric values to be displayed.  Any actual values more than three
sigma the estimated standard deviations are highlighted.

<P>The 2D options shows a 2-dimensional resprestation of the molecule.

<H6>Action</H6>
<img src="images/reel_action_menu.png">

<P>Geometry optimisation using a simple force field can be perform using the
first option.  This is also available in the toolbar as is the semi-empirical
quantum method, AM1, optimisation using the eLBOW dialog.

<P>The last three options will open the eLBOW dialog with either no defaults,
the file initially loaded for the molecule or the current CIF restraints, 
respectively.  Once the eLBOW job is finished the user is promoted to 
choose what to do with the results.

<P><img src="images/reel_geometry_transfer.png">
<P>"Geometry transfer" will update the cartesian coordiantes of the molecule
while the "Geometry and restraints transfer" will update the ideal values of
the restraints.  The former can be combined with the View -> "List geometry
values" menu option to see the differences.
