<p>The structure comparison GUI is a tool for parallel validation and analysis
of near-identical protein structures, such as different crystal forms, various
mutants, or NCS-related copies.  It displays validation outliers and regions
of difference for a set of individual chains on a spreadsheet-like grid, which
is linked to the graphics windows (Coot and PyMOL).  If desired, both the
extracted chains and electron density maps can be superimposed into a common
frame of reference.  These chains may subsequently be edited in Coot to
ensure consistency and/or fix errors, and recovered in their original
orientations for further refinement and rebuilding.</p>
<p>We have included a set of representative structures of human Protein Kinase A
(PKA) for comparison in the PHENIX distribution.  To automatically set up a
new project with these data, click &quot;New Project&quot; in the main GUI toolbar and
then &quot;Set up tutorial data...&quot; in the dialog which appears, and select
&quot;Protein Kinase A&quot; from the drop-down menu.</p>
<P><H5><U><B>Limitations</B></U></H5><P>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Only a single set of chains can be compared at a time; if you have
a set of heterogeneous complexes, the components need to be dealt with
separately.</li>
<li>All protein chains must be numbered identically; the assumption is that
the original biological sequences are identical.  Support for homologous
structures is planned for the near future.</li>
<li>Insertion codes are not handled well (if at all), especially if the
insertions interrupt the sequential numbering of the adjacent regions.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<P><H5><U><B>Configuration and required inputs</B></U></H5><P>
<p>At a minimum, you will need a sequence file containing a single amino-acid
sequence, and two or more PDB files containing near-identical chains.  We
recommend that you also provide either X-ray data or pre-calculated map
coefficients (the latter are preferred since these calculations are the
slowest part of the program).  The files generated by <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">phenix.refine</span></tt> or
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">phenix.maps</span></tt> are suitable for the latter.  Each PDB file may contain an
unlimited number of matching chains; in the PKA example, the structure
1syk has two copies of the catalyitic subunit, while the rest contain only one.
Non-matching chains will be ignored.</p>
<div class="image"><img alt="images/structure_comparison_main.png" src="images/structure_comparison_main.png" /></div>
<p>Currently the options for adding large numbers of files are limited.  PDB files
may be dragged into the list at the top of the window.  If you have a directory
containing multiple allowed file types, you may simply drag the directory in,
and it will automatically guess the appropriate use for each file.  Reflections
will not appear in the main list, but can be viewed by clicking either of the
buttons labeled &quot;X-ray data&quot; or &quot;Map coefficients&quot;.  If the PDB files and
reflections use similar root filenames, the association between them will
be guessed automatically.  For instance, the following pair of files will
automatically be recognized as model and experimental data:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
1syk.pdb
1syk.mtz
</pre>
<p>while these will be recognized as model and map coefficients:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
1syk.pdb
1syk_map_coeffs.mtz
</pre>
<p>If the program does not automatically guess the associations correctly, you
can manually specify which model goes with each reflections file.</p>
<div class="image"><img alt="images/structure_comparison_xray_data.png" src="images/structure_comparison_xray_data.png" /></div>
<p>The map calculations have been parallelized, and this part of the program
scales extremely well over multiple processors.  The GUI will automatically
be set to use NCPU - 1 processes, but you may reduce this if desired.</p>
<p>The most important configurable option is the choice of superposing the
models and maps prior for viewing together in Coot or PyMOL.  This is very
advantageous for comparing regions of difference, instead of switching between
views for each chain.  However, it has the drawback of removing the chains
being analyzed from their original context, possibly obscuring other features
that account for the observed structures.  If you choose to turn on the
superpositioning, the extracted chains will be written out as separate files
in the results directory (along with reoriented maps for each chain, if
available).  Otherwise, the original models will be used for viewing.
(Note that the analyses which depend on local environment in the crystal will
still be run on the original models, and the coordinates mapped to their
new positions.)</p>
<P><H5><U><B>Results</B></U></H5><P>
<p>All output files will be written to a directory named StructureComparison_X
(where X is the job ID).  If you have turned on structure superpositioning,
there will be a separate PDB file for each chain, plus CCP4 map files if
map coefficients were available.  If the map coefficients were calculated from
input X-ray data (not pre-calculated) these will also be written out.</p>
<p>When the application is finished running, a new window will open with separate
tabs for each analysis.  Each tab contains a grid with chains organized one
per row, and residues of interest in columns.  Color coding indicates the
relationship of the specific residue in each cell to the equivalent residues,
and/or properties such as validation outlier or multiple conformations.
Cells colored in grey indicated residues missing from the input chain.</p>
<div class="image"><img alt="images/structure_comparison_results.png" src="images/structure_comparison_results.png" /></div>
<p>Both validation and unrelated atomic properties are included in the
application; in theory, any analysis easily reduced to per-residue information
can also be integrated.  The criteria used to display results vary widely,
but as the primary purpose of the program is to highlight regions of
difference, homogeneous regions will usually be omitted from the grid.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rotamers:</strong> Any set of matching residues containing more than one
rotamer type will be included, plus all outliers.  Coloring: red for
outliers, yellow for &quot;minority&quot; conformations, green for &quot;majority&quot;
conformations (at least 50% of chains under consideration), blue for
multiple conformations.</li>
<li><strong>Ramachandran angles:</strong> Any set of matching residues with phi,psi angles
falling outside the &quot;favored&quot; regions of the Ramachandran plot will be
displayed.  Coloring: red for outliers, yellow for &quot;allowed&quot; angles,
green for &quot;favored&quot;, blue for multiple conformations.</li>
<li><strong>Secondary structure:</strong> Any set of matching residues with more than one
type of secondary structure assignment will be included.  (This uses
the program KSDSSP to annotate the structure.)  Coloring: yellow for
unstructured/loop, green for helical, blue for beta-sheet.</li>
<li><strong>Missing atoms:</strong> Any set of matching residues with at least one atom
missing will be displayed.  Coloring: red for residues missing backbone
atoms (C, O, N, CA, or CB), yellow for residues missing sidechain atoms,
green for complete residues.</li>
</ul>

<P><H5><U><B>Interacting with Coot</B></U></H5><P>
<p>To show controls for sending data to and from Coot, click the icon on the
toolbar of the results window.  A small panel will appear:</p>
<div class="image"><img alt="images/structure_comparison_coot_controls.png" src="images/structure_comparison_coot_controls.png" /></div>
<p>Click the button labeled &quot;Load models and maps&quot; to read all structures into
Coot simultaneously.  Once this is complete they will appear in a checklist
in PHENIX; unchecking any structure will hide the associated objects in Coot.
As with other validation programs in the PHENIX GUI, clicking on the field for
any residue in the results grid will recenter Coot on that residue (in the
appropriate frame of reference depending on whether models were superposed).
You may now adjust the models to match a consensus if desired.</p>
<div class="image"><img alt="images/structure_comparison_coot.png" src="images/structure_comparison_coot.png" /></div>
<p>If the structures were superposed, you should not try to use the models in
Coot for further refinement.  Instead, click the button labeled &quot;Fetch
modified structures&quot; to write out the models from Coot to the results
directory.  PHENIX will automatically recover the original orientation and
replace the unmodified chain in the input structure with the model from Coot,
while leaving all other atoms in place.  The complete files will be written
out to the result directory, renamed with the extension &quot;_modified.pdb&quot;.</p>
