<P><H5><U>Purpose</U></H5><P>

If you have a single copy of your molecule placed in the crystal and you 
have a set of NCS operators defined in an ncs_info.ncs_spec file (such as that
written by phenix.find_ncs), you can apply the operators to your molecule
to generate all the NCS copies.  This can be useful if you want to work on one
molecule in your asymmetric unit and propagate it to the other copies. You
can generate your ncs_info.ncs_spec file using phenix.find_ncs and your
original model containing all the NCS copies, then apply it to any one of the
individual molecules to regenerate the others.

<P><H5>How apply_ncs works:</H5><P>

apply_ncs assumes that you are supplying it with one copy of your molecule,
placed in your unit cell, and that you are also supplying a ncs_info.ncs_spec
file that contains all the NCS operators for your structure along with the
approximate molecular centers where each operator applies.
apply_ncs assumes that the NCS operator with a center closest to the center of
the molecule you supply (including space-group symmetry)
is the operator corresponding to your input molecule.

<P>apply_ncs then calculates the transformation for your molecule to 
molecule 1, and then uses all the NCS operators to transform molecule 1 to
each NCS copy.

the NCS-related positions in your structure

<P><H5><U>Examples</U></H5><P>

<P><H5>Standard run of apply_ncs:</H5><P>

  Running apply_ncs is easy. From the command-line you can
type:
<PRE style="face=courier">phenix.apply_ncs  mol1.pdb my_ncs.ncs_spec
</PRE>

If apply_ncs chooses the wrong NCS copy to match up to your input molecule,
you can tell it which one your input molecule is with match_copy:

<PRE style="face=courier">phenix.apply_ncs mol1.pdb my_ncs.ncs_spec match_copy=2
</PRE>
apply_ncs will then assume that you are inputting ncs copy 2.
