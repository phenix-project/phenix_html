PyMOL executables are kindly supplied by Warren DeLano for distribution 
in PHENIX.

      <P><H5><U>Starting PyMOL</U></H5><P>
<P>Normally you will start PyMOL in PHENIX after one of the PHENIX Wizards 
has finished. In this case if you click on the magnifying glass on the
Wizard screen, and select one of the choices that displays a structure
with PyMOL, then PyMOL will automatically be launched with the appropriate
PDB and map files.
</P> <P> You can also start PyMOL by clicking on the PyMOL button on the
PHENIX GUI. In this case you'll need to read in maps and models yourself.
You can read in  a model to PyMOL by typing
<PRE style="face=courier">load overall_best.pdb
</PRE>
in the PyMOL Tcl/Tk GUI window or at the PyMOL prompt in the PyMOL display
window.

      <P><H5><U>Setting up your view in PyMOL</U></H5><P>
<p>Here are some simple controls that let you choose what you see in PyMOL, assuming
that you have a model (pdb_1) and a map (map_1) or maps loaded.

<UL>
<LI>
Click a few times on &quot;pdb_1&quot; you will see the model turn off and
on. Same for &quot;contour_1.5&quot;.  
Similarly &quot;all&quot; turns everything on and off, and &quot;map_1&quot; 
turns the unit cell box (which may not be visible in your viewer) on and off.
</LI>

<LI>
To the right of  &quot;pdb_1&quot; you will see buttons labelled
 &quot;A&quot; &quot;S&quot; &quot;H&quot; &quot;L&quot; and &quot;C&quot;.
Click on each one and you'll see what they do:
  <UL>
    <LI> &quot;A&quot;  : Actions. lets you recenter, delete the object, and more </LI>
    <LI> &quot;S&quot; : Show. For a model you may want to show sticks for clarity.  </LI>
    <LI> &quot;H&quot; : Hide. Undoes show.  </LI>
    <LI> &quot;L&quot; : Label. Choose what labels to display </LI>
    <LI> &quot;C&quot; : Color. Choose colors.  </LI>
  </UL>
</LI>

<LI>
The little table in the lower right of the PyMOL display window
shows what each mouse button does.  If you have a
3-button (2 buttons and a roller) mouse, then
hold the left button down and move the mouse
to rotate; right button down and move the mouse to
change the size; both buttons down and move the
mouse to move the center.
</LI>
<LI>
If you accidentally click the wrong buttons
and some new object appears on the screen that
you do not want, click on the &quot;A&quot; botton
for the new object and select &quot;delete&quot;
to get rid of it.
</LI>
</UL>

      <P><H5><U>Useful PyMOL commands</U></H5><P>

Here are a few useful PyMOL commands that you can type in the PyMOL window
or in the PyMOL Tcl/Tk GUI window.

<UL>
<LI> Read in a pdb file named &quot;overall_best.pdb&quot;:
<PRE style="face=courier">load overall_best.pdb </PRE> </LI>

<LI> Read in a xplor-style map named &quot;map_1.xplor&quot; and contour it
at a level of 1.5: 
<PRE style="face=courier">
load map_1.xplor
isomesh contour_1, map_1, 1.5
 </PRE> </LI>

<LI> Create a new set of contours at a level of 2.5 for a map
called &quot;map_1&quot; that has already been loaded:
<PRE style="face=courier">
isomesh contour_1, map_1, 2.5
 </PRE> </LI>

<LI> Get PyMOL help;
<PRE style="face=courier">
help
 </PRE> </LI>

<LI> Get PyMOL help on the command &quot;isomesh&quot; 
<PRE style="face=courier">
help isomesh
 </PRE> </LI>

</UL>
