For different molecular replacement solutions from the same dataset phenix.find_alt_orig_sym_mate.py
finds for each chain in the moving solution the copy closest to chains in the fixed solution with
respect to all symmetry operations and alternative origin shifts permitted by the
spacegroup of the crystal.

phenix.find_alt_orig_sym_mate.py can be run from the command-line with phil input 
in either a text file or as keywords like
<PRE style="face=courier">find_alt_orig_sym_mate.py moving.xyzfname=pdbfile1 fixed.xyzfname=pdbfile2
</PRE>
or
<PRE style="face=courier">phenix.find_alt_orig_sym_mate.py my_phil_input.txt.
</PRE>
    <br />
    The PHIL input has two scopes, "moving" and "fixed".

Both of the scopes must hold
    valid content for the program to work. The two scopes
hold the parameter "xyzfname" and the sub-scopes "mrsolution" and "pickle_solution". For a scope to be valid one
    and only of the procedures a, b and c must be followed.<P><a name="anch13" id="Usage_5"></a>

(a) Assign the "xyzfname parameter" to the pdb file from one of the MR solutions
in question.

<P><a name="anch14" id="Usage_6"></a>

(b) Specify a Phaser MR solution by assigning the file name
of the solution file to the "mrsolution.solfname" parameter as well as assigning
the IDs of the ensembles and the corresponding MR models to the parameters
"mrsolution.ensembles.name" and "mrsolution.ensembles.xyzfname" respectively.
Multiple components are specified as multiple ensembles. This way of specifying
solutions is useful for solutions produced when Phaser is run directly from the
command line.

<P><a name="anch15" id="Usage_7"></a>

(c) Specify a pickle solution. In that case the parameter
pickle_solution.pklfname is assigned to the solution file that is produced
by PHENIX after an MR calculation. The pickle_solution.philfname is then
assigned to the input file for the MR calculation. This way of specifying
solutions is useful when MR solutions are available from having run Phaser
through the PHENIX interface.

<P><a name="anch16" id="Usage_8"></a>

All three ways may be combined. If space group and the unit cell dimensions
is not available when for instance (b) is used for both the moving and the
fixed scopes then these need to be specified by assigning the parameter,
"spacegroupfname", to a pdb file with a CRYST1 record or to an mtz file with
that information.

The closest match between chains in the moving section to chains in the fixed
section is saved with the name of the fixed_pdb,
concatenated with the name of the moving_pdb but prepended with "MinMLAD_".
A log file with the name of the fixed_pdb, concatenated with the name of the
moving_pdb but prepended with "AltOrigSymMLAD_" contains all screen output.
All files are saved in the current working directory. A good match
between two chains usually have a MLAD value less than 1.5
whereas a bad match usually have a value larger than 2. This is a rule of thumb
and exceptions do occur. If MR solutions specified in the
    PHIL contains multiple solutions then find_alt_orig_sym_mate will output mulitple
    log files corresponding to each MR solution.<P><a name="anch22" id="Algorithm"></a>
<H5>Algorithm</H5>
<P><a name="anch23" id="Algorithm_2"></a>


<P><a name="anch24" id="Algorithm_3"></a>
find_alt_orig_sym_mate.py computes configurations by looping over all
symmetry operations and alternative origin shifts. These are computed using
procedures outlined in R. W. Groﬂe-Kunstleve, Acta Cryst. 1999, A55, 383-395.
An alignment between C-alpha atoms from moving_pdb and fixed_pdb is
computed using SSM (E. Krissinel* and K. Henrick, Acta Cryst. 2004. D60, 2256-2268).
To estimate the best match a distance measure between the aligned atoms is
computed for each configuration. The mean log absolute deviation (MLAD) is
defined as:

<P><a name="anch25" id="Algorithm_4"></a>

  MLAD(dR) = Sum( log(dr*dr/(|dr| + 0.9) + max(0.9, min(dr*dr,1)))),

<P><a name="anch26" id="Algorithm_5"></a>

where dr is the difference vector between a pair of aligned C-alpha atoms and the sum
is taken over all atom pairs in the alignment. MLAD is used as the distance measure.
MLAD will downplay the contributions of spatially distant C-alpha atom pairs which
may otherwise lead to incorrect matches when the space group has a floating origin
and the chains tested against one another consists of large unaligned domains.

<P><a name="anch27" id="Algorithm_6"></a>

find_alt_orig_sym_mate.py will for each chain in fixed_pdb find the
smallest MLAD with a copy of each chain in moving_pdb for a given symmetry
operation and alternative origin. When all chains in fixed_pdb
    have been
tested these copies will be saved to a file. A warning is issued if not all
saved copies of chains in moving_pdb have the same origin.

<P><a name="anch28" id="Algorithm_7"></a>

For spacegroups with floating origin the minimum MLAD is found
by doing a Golden Sectioning minimization along the polar axis for each copy
of chains in moving_pdb.

<P><a name="anch29" id="Algorithm_8"></a>

<H5>Debug mode</H5>
<P><a name="anch31" id="Debug_mode_2"></a>


<P><a name="anch32" id="Debug_mode_3"></a>

Invoking the debug flag produces individual pdb files of the C-alpha atoms used for
each SSM alignment of moving_pdb for each permitted symmetry operation and alternative
origin. A gold atom is placed at the centroid of the C-alpha atoms. Similar files are
produced for the fixed_pdb. These files are stored in a subfolder named
"AltOrigSymMatesFiles".

If a floating origin is present in the space group a table of MLAD values is produced by
sliding a copy of moving_pdb along the polar axis in the fractional interval [-0.5, 0.5]
for each permitted symmetry operation and alternative origin.
