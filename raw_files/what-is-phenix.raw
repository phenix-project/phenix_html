<P> The PHENIX software suite is a highly automated system for
macromolecular structure determination that can rapidly arrive at an
initial partial model of a structure without significant human
intervention, given moderate resolution and good quality data.  This
achievement has been made possible by the development of new
algorithms for structure determination, maximum-likelihood molecular
replacement (PHASER), heavy-atom search (HySS), template and
pattern-based automated model-building (RESOLVE, TEXTAL), automated
macromolecular refinement (phenix.refine), and iterative
model-building, density modification and refinement that can operate
at moderate resolution (RESOLVE, AutoBuild). These algorithms are
based on a highly integrated and comprehensive set of crystallographic
libraries that have been built and made available to the
community. The algorithms are tightly linked and made easily
accessible to users through the PHENIX Wizards and the command line.

<P> There are also a number of tools in PHENIX for handling
ligands. Automated fitting of ligands into the electron density is
facilitated via the LigandFit wizard.  Besides being able to fit a
known ligand into a difference map, the LigandFit wizard is capable to
identify ligands on the basis of the difference density only. Stereo
chemical dictionaries of ligands whose chemical description is not
available in the supplied monomer library for the use in restrained
macromolecular refinement can be generated with the electronic ligand
builder and optimization workbench (eLBOW).

<P> PHENIX builds upon Python, the Boost.Python Library, and C++ to
provide an environment for automation and scientific computing. Many
of the fundamental crystallographic building blocks, such as data
objects and tools for their manipulation are provided by the
Computational Crystallography Toolbox (cctbx). The computational tasks
which perform complex crystallographic calculations are then built on
top of this. Finally, there are a number of different user interfaces
available in PHENIX. In order to facilitate automated operation there
is the Project Data Storage (PDS) that is used to store and track the
results of calculations.

<P> The PHENIX development team consists of members from Lawrence
Berkeley Laboratory (Paul Adams's group), Los Alamos National
Laboratory (Tom Terwilliger's group), Cambridge University (Randy
Read's group) and Duke University (the Richardsons' group).
Researchers from Texas A&M University (Tom Ioerger's and Jim
Sacchettini's groups) participated in the first five years of PHENIX
development. 

<P> The development of PHENIX is funded by the National Institutes of
Health (General Medicine) under grant P01GM063210.
