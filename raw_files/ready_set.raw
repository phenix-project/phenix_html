<H5><U>Purpose</U></H5>

<I>ReadySet!</I> is a program designed to prepare a PDB file for refinement
as in <I>ReadySet! Refine!!!</I>.  It will add hydrogens to the protein model
using phenix.reduce and to the ligands using eLBOW.  The appropriate 
restraints are also written to disk.
Hydrogens can also
be added to water molecules.  Deuterium atoms can be added to facilitate
dual xray-neutron refinement.  Metal coordination files are also
generated.

<H5><U>General Procedure</U></H5>

<H5>Ligand hydrogen addition</H5>
Including hydrogens in a refinement leads to better models.  <I>ReadySet!</I>
will add hydrogens to the ligands using eLBOW and PDB Chemical Components.
The input PDB file is divided into 'standard' residues including the standard
aminoacids and RNA/DNA bases.  The other residues (usually ligands)
are tested using the 
three-letter and atomic names against the PHENIX monomer library and the
PDB Chemical Components database.

<P>
If the ligand is determined to be in the PHENIX monomer library then the
hydrogens are added with the atom naming from the library.  This is done using
a SMILES string taken from the PDB Chemical Components database and the
atom names from the monomer library.  In this case,
the hydrogens are added to the output PDB file but there is no restraints
written because phenix.refine will use the library restraints.

<P>
If the ligand is determined to be in the PDB Chemical Components database,
the SMILES string and the atom names are used to generate a molecule that
represents the ligand.  The atomic naming is determined using either the
version 2 or version 3 PDB names.  The restraints are written to disk.

<P>
If no match is found in the PHENIX monomer library or PDB Chemical 
Components database, the residue atoms are used to generate the ligand.
The restraints are written to disk.

<P>
Once there is a ligand representation including hydrogens, the ligand must
be included in the output.  For each copy of the ligand in the model the
presentation is pruned to match the number of non-hydrogen atoms and overlayed
onto the ligand orientation.  Hydrogens are added in an optimised geometry
for each copy of the ligand.

<P>
Covalently bound ligands are handled and two files, the CIF link restraints
file and the atom selection file, are output.

<H5>Metal coordination</H5>

Any metals in the model are coordinated and the results output in an "edits"
for phenix.refine.  The distances and angles in the PDB file are used in the
output.

<H5>Neutron exchange addition</H5>

Deuteriums are added to aminoacids that exhibit exchangeable sites.  The 
hydrogens are placed in alternative location "A" and the corresponding 
deuteriums are placed in "B".
