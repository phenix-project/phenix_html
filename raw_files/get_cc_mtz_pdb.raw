<P><H5><U>Purpose</U></H5><P>

get_cc_mtz_pdb is a command line tool for adjusting the origin of a PDB file
using space-group symmetry
so that the PDB file superimposes on a map, obtaining the correlation
of model and map, and analyzing the correlation for each residue.

<P><H5><U>Usage</U></H5><P>

<P><H5>How get_cc_mtz_pdb works:</H5><P>

get_cc_mtz_pdb calculates a model map based on the supplied PDB file, then
uses RESOLVE to find the origin shift (using space-group symmetry)
that maximizes the correlation of this
model map with a map calculated with the supplied map
coefficients in an mtz file. This shift is applied to the atoms in the
PDB file to create <b>offset.pdb</b> and then the 
correlation, residue-by-residue
of <b>offset.pdb</b> with the map is analyzed. Atoms and
residues that are out of density or are in weak density are flagged.
<p>You can set several parameters to define how the correlations
are calculated. 
<p>By default model density is calculated using the 
atom types, occupancies and isotropic thermal factors (B-values) 
supplied in the PDB file. If you specify 
<PRE style="face=courier">
scale=True
</PRE>
then an overall B as
well as an increment in B-values for each atom beyond CB (for proteins)
will be added to the values in the PDB file, after adjusting these parameters
to maximize the map correlation.  
<p>If you specify  
<PRE style="face=courier">
use_only_refl_present_in_mtz=True
</PRE>
then the model-based map
will be calculated using the same set of reflections as the map calculated
from your input mtz file. This reduces the contribution of missing reflections
on the calculation (but the correlation is no longer the actual map-model
correlation).

<p>In the calculation of the map correlation in the region of the model, the
region where the model is located is defined as all points within a
distance rad_max of an atom in the model. The value of rad_max is adjusted
in each case to maximize this correlation. Its value is typically similar
to the high-resolution limit of the map.

<b>offset.pdb</b>: A PDB file offset to match the origin in the mtz file.

<P><H5><U>Examples</U></H5><P>

<P><H5>Standard run of get_cc_mtz_pdb:</H5><P>

  Running the get_cc_mtz_pdb is easy. From the command-line you can
type:
<PRE style="face=courier">phenix.get_cc_mtz_pdb map_coeffs.mtz coords.pdb
</PRE>

If you want (or need) to specify the column names from your mtz file, you
will need to tell get_cc_mtz_pdb what FP and PHIB (and optionally FOM)
are, in this format:

<PRE style="face=courier">phenix.get_cc_mtz_pdb map_coeffs.mtz coords.pdb \
labin="FP=2FOFCWT PHIB=PH2FOFCWT"
</PRE>

<P><H5><U>Possible Problems</U></H5><P>

<P><H5>Specific limitations and problems:</H5><P>
In versions of PHENIX up to 1.3-final, defaults were set to maximize the
correlation coefficient rather than to give the correlation using the existing
thermal parameters and including only the reflections present in the
mtz file.  These previous defaults were equivalent to using the values:
<PRE style="face=courier">
scale=True
use_only_refl_present_in_mtz=True
</PRE>
These defaults were changed so that the correlation values obtained by default
in a case where no origin shifts are needed
would correspond to those obtained by simply calculating (1) a map using the
input map coefficients and (2) a map from the PBB file and then determining the
correlation between these maps.
