<H5><U>Data Analysis</U></H5>

<P>Detection of twinning and other pathologies is facilitated via the
program <a href="xtriage.htm">phenix.xtriage</a>. This command line driven program analyses an
experimental data set and provides diagnostics that aid in the
detection of common idiosyncrasies such as the presence of pseudo
translational symmetry, certain data processing problems and
twinning. Other sanity checks, such as a Wilson plot sanity check and
an algorithm that tries to detect the presence of ice rings from the
merged data are performed as well.  If twin laws are present for the
given unit cell and space group, a Britton plot is computed, an H-test
is performed and a likelihood based method is used to provide an
estimate of the twin fraction. Twin laws are deduced from first
principles for each data set, avoiding the danger of over-looking twin
laws by incomplete lookup tables. If a model is available, more
efficient twin detection tools are available. The RvsR statistic is
particularly useful in the detection of twinning in combination with
pseudo rotational symmetry. This statistic is computed by
phenix.xtriage if calculated data is supplied together with the
observed data. A more direct test for the presence of twinning is by
refinement of the twin fraction given an atomic model (which can be
performed in phenix.refine). The command line utility
phenix.twin_map_utils provides a quick way to refine a twin fraction
given an atomic model and an X-ray data set and also produces

<H5><U>Automated Structure Solution Using Experimental Phasing Techniques</U></H5>

<P>Structure solution via SAD, MAD or SIR(AS) can be carried out with the
<a href="autosol.htm">AutoSol</a> wizard. 
The <a href="autosol.htm">AutoSol</a> wizard performs heavy atom location,
phasing, density modification and initial model building in an
automated manner.  The heavy atoms are located with substructure
solution engine also used in phenix.hyss, a dual space method similar
to SHELXD and Shake and Bake. Phasing is carried out with PHASER for
SAD cases and with SOLVE for MAD and SIR(AS) cases. Subsequent density
modification is carried out with RESOLVE. The hand of the substructure
is determined automatically on the basis of the quality of the
resulting electron density map. It is noteworthy that the whole
process is not necessarily linear but that the wizard can decide to
step back and (for instance) try another set of heavy atoms if
appropriate.  In the resulting electron density map, a model is built
(currently limited to proteins). Further model completion can be
carried out via the <a href="autobuild.htm">AutoBuild</a> 
wizard. The <a href="autobuild.htm">AutoBuild</a> wizard iterates
model building and density modification with refinement of the model
in a scheme similar to other iterative model building methods, for
example ARP/wARP.

<H5><U>Automated Structure Solution Via Molecular Replacement</U></H5>

<P>Structure solution via molecular replacement is facilitated via the
<a href="automr.htm">AutoMR</a> wizard. 
The <a href="automr.htm">AutoMR</a> wizard guides the user through setting up
all necessary parameters to run a molecular replacement job with
PHASER.  The molecular replacement carried out by PHASER uses
likelihood based scoring function, improving the sensitivity
of the procedure and the ability to obtain reasonable solutions with
search models that have a relatively low sequence similarity to the
crystal structure being determined. Besides the use of likelihood
based scoring functions, structure solution is enhanced by detailed
bookkeeping of all search possibilities when searching for more then a
single copy in the asymmetric unit or when there the choice of space
group is ambiguous.  When a suitable molecular replacement solution is
found, the <a href="autobuild.htm">AutoBuild</a> wizard 
is invoked and rebuilds the molecular
replacement model given the sequence of the model under investigation.

<H5><U>Automated Model Building</U></H5>

<P>Automated model building given a starting model or a set of reasonable
phases can be carried out by the <a href="autobuild.htm">AutoBuild</a> wizard. A typical AutoBuild
job combines density modification, model building, macromolecular
refinement and solvent model updates ('water picking') in an iterative
manner.  Various modes of building a model are available. Depending on
the availability of a molecular model, model building can be carried
by locally rebuilding an existing model (rebuild in place) or by
building in the density without any information of an available
model. The rebuilding in place model building is a powerful building
scheme that is used by default for molecular replacement models that
have a high sequence similarity to the sequence of the structure that
is to be built.  
A fundamental feature of the <a href="autobuild.htm">AutoBuild</a> wizard is that
it builds various models, all from slightly different starting
points. The dependency of the outcome of the model building algorithm
on initial starting conditions provides a straightforward mechanism to
obtain a variety of plausible molecular models. It is not uncommon
that certain sections of a map are built in one model, while not in
another. Combining these models allows the 
<a href="autobuild.htm">AutoBuild</a> wizard to
converge faster to a more complete model than when using a single
model building pass for a given set of phases.  Dedicated loop fitting
algorithms are used to close gaps between chain segments.  This
feature, together with the water picking and side chain placement,
typically results in highly complete models of high quality that need
minimal manual intervention before they are ready for deposition.

<H5><U>Structure Refinement</U></H5>

<P>The refinement engine 
used in the <a href="autobuild.htm">AutoBuild</a> and <a href="autosol.htm">AutoSol</a> wizards can
also be run from the command line with the <a href="refinement.htm">phenix.refine</a> command. The
phenix.refine program carries out likelihood based refinement and has
the possibility to refine positional parameters, individual or grouped
atomic displacement parameters, individual or grouped occupancies. The
refinement of anisotropic displacement parameters (individual or via a
TLS parameterization) is also available. Positional parameters can be
optimized using either traditional gradient-only based optimization
methods, or via simulated annealing protocols.  The command line
interface allows the user to specify which part of the model should be
refined in what manner. It is in principle possible to refine half of
the molecule as a rigid group with grouped B values, whereas the other
half of the molecule has a TLS parameterization. The flexibility of
specifying the level of parameterization of the model is especially
important for the refinement of low resolution data or when starting
with severely incomplete atomic models. Another advantage of this
flexibility in refinement strategy is that a user can perform a
complex refinement protocol that carries out simulated annealing,
isotropic B refinement and water picking in 'one go'.  Another main
feature of <a href="refinement.htm">phenix.refine</a> is the way in which the relative weights for
the geometric and ADP restraints with respect to the X-ray target are
determined. Considerable effort has been put into devising a good set
of defaults and weight determination schemes that results in a good
choice of parameters for the data set under investigation. Defaults
can of course be overwritten if the user chooses to.  Besides being
able to handle refinement against X-ray data, <a href="refinement.htm">phenix.refine</a> can refine
against neutron data or against X-ray and neutron data simultaneously.

<H5><U>Automated ligand density analysis</U></H5>

<P>Automated fitting of ligands into the electron density is facilitated
via the <a href="ligandfit.htm">LigandFit</a> wizard.  
The ligand building is performed by finding
an initial fit for the largest rigid domain of the ligand and
extending the remaining part of the ligand from this initial
'seed'. Besides being able to fit a known ligand into a difference
map, the <a href="ligandfit.htm">LigandFit</a> wizard is capable 
of identifying ligands on the basis
of the difference density only. In the latter scheme, density
characteristics for ligands occurring frequently in the PDB are used
to provide the user with a range of plausible ligands.

<H5><U>Calculating ligand geometries and defining chemical restraints</U></H5>

<P>Stereo chemical dictionaries of ligands whose chemical description is
not available in the supplied monomer library for the use in
restrained macromolecular refinement can be generated with the
electronic ligand builder and optimization workbench (eLBOW). eLBOW
generates a 3D geometry from a number of chemical input formats
including MOL2 or PDB files and SMILES strings. SMILES is a compact,
chemically dense description of a molecule that contains all element
and bonding information and optionally other stereo information such
as chirality.  To generate a 3D geometry from an input format that
contains no 3D geometry information, <a href="elbow.htm">eLBOW</a> uses a Z-Matrix formalism
in conjunction with a table of bond lengths calculated using the
Hartree-Fock method with a 6-31G(d,p) basis set to obtain a Cartesian
coordinate set. The geometry is then optionally optimized using the
semi-empirical quantum chemistry method AM1. The AM1 optimization
provides chemically meaningful and accurate geometries for the class
of molecule typically complexed with proteins. <a href="elbow.htm">eLBOW</a> outputs the
optimized geometry and a standard CIF restraint file that can be read
in by <a href="refinement.htm">phenix.refine</a> and can also be used for real space refinement
during manual model building sessions in the program COOT. An
interface is also available to use <a href="elbow.htm">eLBOW</a> within COOT.
