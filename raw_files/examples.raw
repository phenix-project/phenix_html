<P><H5><U><B>Where can I find sample data?</B></U></H5><P>
<p>You can find sample data in the directories located in: $PHENIX/examples.
Additionally there is sample MR data in $PHENIX/phaser/tutorial.  The <a class="reference" href="phenix_gui.htm">PHENIX
GUI</a> provides the ability to automatically set up any of
the tutorial datasets.  When the GUI is started for the first time, a dialog
window will appear asking you to create a project:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="image"><img alt="images/new_project.png" src="images/new_project.png" /></div>
</blockquote>
<p>Click the button &quot;Set up tutorial data&quot; to select a tutorial.  A new window
will appear with a drop-down menu listing all of the tutorial datasets grouped
by category (Experimental phasing, Molecular replacement, etc.).  By default
the necessary files will be copied to a new directory in your Documents folder
(if present, otherwise the home directory will be used), but you may use any
destination you wish.</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="image"><img alt="images/tutorial_setup.png" src="images/tutorial_setup.png" /></div>
</blockquote>
<p>A README file is available for some projects; this contains important
information such as the wavelengths and anomalous scattering coefficients (f'
and f'') for MAD datasets.</p>
<P><H5><U><B>Can I easily run a Wizard with some sample data?</B></U></H5><P>
<p>You can run sample data from the command line with a Wizard with a simple
command. To run p9-sad sample data with the AutoSol wizard, you type:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
phenix.run_example  p9-sad
</pre>
<p>This command copies the $PHENIX/examples/p9-sad directory to your working
directory and executes the commands in the file run.sh.  Documentation for
running tutorials in the GUI is currently in preparation.</p>
<P><H5><U><B>What sample data are available to run automatically?</B></U></H5><P>
<p>You can see which sample data are set up to run automatically by typing:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
phenix.run_example  --help
</pre>
<p>This command lists all the directories in $PHENIX/examples/ that have a
command file run.sh ready to use. For example:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
phenix.run_example  --help

PHENIX run_example script. Fri Jul  6 12:07:08 MDT 2007

Use: phenix.run_example example_name [--all] [--overwrite]
Data will be copied from PHENIX examples into subdirectories
of this working directory
If --all is set then all examples will be run (takes a long time!)
If --overwrite is set then the script will overwrite subdirectories

List of available examples:  1J4R-ligand a2u-globulin-mr gene-5-mad
p9-build p9-sad
</pre>
<P><H5><U><B>Are any of the sample datasets annotated?</B></U></H5><P>
<p>The PHENIX tutorials listed on the main PHENIX web page will walk you through
sample datasets, telling you what to look for in the output files. For example,
the Tutorial 1: Solving a structure using SAD data tutorial uses the p9-sad
dataset as example. It tells you how to run this example data in AutoSol and
how to interpret the results.</p>
