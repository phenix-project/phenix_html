<p>This tutorial shows how to use the <a class="reference" href="phaser_mr.htm">Phaser-MR GUIs</a> to solve
structures by molecular replacement, using example data included with the
Phenix distribution.  We recommend reading the
<a class="reference" href="mr_overview.htm">MR overview</a> before running these tutorials (and for
adventurous users, the primary Phaser reference as well).</p>
<p>A brief word about terminology: the search models used in Phaser are
customarily named &quot;ensembles&quot;, and in fact Phaser will often work best in 
difficult cases when a set of superposed models (generated using <a class="reference" href="ensembler.htm">Ensembler</a> or similar tools) is used.  However, this is not required
and for easily solved structures, such as the tutorial datasets used here,
a single PDB file will be sufficient.  Furthermore, while Phaser can search
for multiple alternative ensembles and output only the best solution, here we
will use just one candidate per component.  Also note that the search models
used here are single proteins, but this is not a requirement if the relative
orientation of multiple chains are known (such as physiological dimers,
multi-subunit complexes, or DNA helices).</p>
<p>An essential feature of Phaser is that it scores possible solutions based on
the expected crystal composition (that is, the scattering mass).  Therefore,
for the examples shown here, we will be supplying sequence files for the
crystallized proteins.  We could, however, specify the molecular weight or
number of residues instead.  Importantly, the manner in which the composition
is specified is completely decoupled from the &quot;ensemble&quot; (search model) input;
where multiple proteins have been crystallized, we could supply separate
sequence files (as is done here for the beta-blip example) or a single file
with multiple sequences, and the result will be identical.  While it is
technically possible to run Phaser with just a search model and extrapolate
the molecular weight based on the desired number of copies, this is not
recommended.</p>
<P><H5><U><B>Single-component searches</B></U></H5><P>
<p>For homogeneous structures where only one component needs to be placed, a
streamlined interface is available.  The tutorial data for this example is
the A2U-globulin structure, which includes one each of data, PDB, and sequence
files.  In this interface, it is assumed that multiple PDB files are part of
a single ensemble; if you instead want to try multiple equally likely
ensembles and let Phaser pick the best one, use the advanced interface
(described below).</p>
<p>Start the GUI by clicking &quot;Phaser-MR (simple interface)&quot;, the first item in
the list under &quot;Molecular replacement.&quot;  This interface has a single input
field for all file types, and on most operating systems you can simply drag
the three files from the project folder into the input field.  Alternatively,
click &quot;Add file&quot; to open a file dialog.</p>
<div class="image"><img alt="images/a2u-globulin_input.png" src="images/a2u-globulin_input.png" /></div>
<p>The symmetry information and labels list will automatically be populated when
the reflections are loaded; you do not need to change the defaults.  You
must enter either the sequence identity or RMSD for each model in the
ensemble; in this case an RMSD of 1.0 is appropriate for the single model used.
If you have no specific idea of the accuracy of the model, it is best to simply 
provide the sequence identity to the target and let Phaser provide the
corresponding RMSD.
Because we already entered a sequence, no molecular weight is required, but
the value for &quot;Component copies&quot; should be set to 4.</p>
<p>The next tab contains basic search options; you should change &quot;Number of copies
to search for&quot; to 4.  (While it may seem inefficient to specify the number
of component copies and the number of search copies separately, this would
allow us to search for a tetramer, while still only supplying the sequence of
one chain.)</p>
<div class="image"><img alt="images/a2u-globulin_search.png" src="images/a2u-globulin_search.png" /></div>
<p>Usually it is best not to specify a resolution limit.  Phaser chooses a
resolution limit based on the particular problem (accuracy and completeness
of the model, number of reflections).  If the problem is expected to be 
straightforward, the resolution will automatically be limited to reduce
runtime while preserving an excellent chance of solving the structure on the 
first pass.</p>
<p>The other controls on this tab do not need to modified, but the option for
alternative space groups deserves special mention.  If there is any ambiguity
about the precise space group, for instance, if the data were processed as
P222 but the exact combination of screw axes is unknown, or the space group
could be either P6(1) or P6(5), Phaser can try multiple space groups and
identify the best one at the translation function stage.  The default is to
try only the enantiomeric space group; this will have no effect for the
examples used here
(the MTZ files already contain the correct symmetry), but it would be
appropriate for the P6(1) versus P6(5) case.  The most permissive setting is
&quot;All possible in the same pointgroup&quot;.</p>
<p>Now we are ready to run Phaser: click the Run button on the toolbar.  A new
tab will appear with a status panel, a list of warnings, and summary output
(basically excerpted from the log file).  For many structures (including this
one) there will be one or more warnings, but these do not necessarily mean
that Phaser will not be successful.  This example should finish in several
minutes.</p>
<div class="image"><img alt="images/a2u-globulin_run.png" src="images/a2u-globulin_run.png" /></div>
<p>Once the run is complete, a results tab will appear, showing a summary of the
solution and output files, with buttons to launch other programs.  The two
statistics reported are the log-likelihood gain (LLG), which expresses the
probability of this solution compared to a random-atom model, and the
translation function Z-score, which denotes the signal-to-noise ratio of
the solution.  In this case both are excellent, indicating that Phaser found
an unambiguous solution.</p>
<div class="image"><img alt="images/a2u-globulin_results.png" src="images/a2u-globulin_results.png" /></div>
<p>At this point we recommend inspecting the maps and crystal packing in Coot.
Because Phaser only performs rigid-body and group B-factor refinement, the map
quality will most likely be relatively poor compared to a refined map, with
many unexplained difference peaks, but they should still be interpretable
for a correct solution.</p>
<p>The appropriate next step would be either rebuilding or refinement, both of
which can be launched directly from the results tab.  For this example we
could go straight to refinement; if the structure was instead solved using
homologous proteins, running AutoBuild would be a better choice.</p>
<P><H5><U><B>Multi-component searches</B></U></H5><P>
<p>The interface for multi-component searches is considerably more complicated,
especially since the ensemble and composition inputs are split up.  The
tutorial data for this example is &quot;TEM-1 Beta-lactamase/beta-lactamaseinhibitor complex&quot; (or &quot;beta-blip&quot;), and includes five files: an MTZ file and
two each of search models and sequence files.</p>
<p>Start the standard Phaser-MR GUI by clicking &quot;Phaser-MR&quot; under the &quot;Molecular
replacement&quot; section.  The first tab that appears defines the experimental
data; click &quot;Browse...&quot; next to the &quot;Data file&quot; field and select the file
named &quot;beta_blip_P3221.mtz&quot;.  The unit cell and space group will be
automatically filled in, and the &quot;Data labels&quot; menu will be populated with
suitable choices (only one in this case).</p>
<div class="image"><img alt="images/beta_blip_1.png" src="images/beta_blip_1.png" /></div>
<p>The other options in this window are equivalent to those in the simple
interface, and do not need to be modified.</p>
<p>The second tab, &quot;Ensembles&quot;, is where the search models are entered.  First
we will load the beta-lactamase model: for &quot;Model ID&quot;, enter &quot;beta&quot;, then
click &quot;Add file&quot; below the list widget and select &quot;beta.pdb&quot;.  This will
add it to the list with the &quot;Variance&quot; field blank.  Click the &quot;Change
variance&quot; button, and enter &quot;100&quot; for the sequence identity and click &quot;OK&quot;.</p>
<div class="image"><img alt="images/beta_variance.png" src="images/beta_variance.png" /></div>
<p>The window should now look like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img alt="images/beta_ensemble.png" src="images/beta_ensemble.png" /></div>
<p>At the bottom of the window, click &quot;Add PDB ensemble&quot;.  A second ensemble
sub-tab will appear.  Now repeat the procedure using &quot;beta.pdb&quot; instead.
(The order in which these ensembles are input is technically not important,
because Phaser will normally determine the appropriate search order
automatically.  However, in this case Phaser will indeed search for beta
first, because it is a significantly larger protein.)</p>
<p>The third configuration tab, &quot;Composition&quot;, is where we tell Phaser what
scattering mass to expect in the crystal.  If we know the exact molecular
weight (or number of residues) of the entire structure, we could simply enter
that here, but we will use sequences instead.  The files &quot;beta.seq&quot; and
&quot;blip.seq&quot; should be input in the &quot;Sequence file&quot; field in successive tabs;
click the button &quot;Add macromolecule(s)&quot; at the bottom of the window to add
a tab.  The number of copies is 1 in both cases.  (Here the order in which the
composition is input really is unimportant.)</p>
<div class="image"><img alt="images/blip_component.png" src="images/blip_component.png" /></div>
<p>The final configuration tab, &quot;Search procedure&quot;, is where we tell Phaser
how to use the ensembles we input, along with several of the most important
search options.  Each search step has its own tab; assuming the ensembles
have been entered appropriately, the tab will initially look like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img alt="images/beta_blip_search.png" src="images/beta_blip_search.png" /></div>
<p>Check &quot;beta&quot;, leaving the number of copies set to 1, then click &quot;Add search&quot;,
and in the new tab, check &quot;blip&quot; (still with 1 copy).  This interface allows
you to check multiple ensembles in a single search, but this would instead
try both as alternatives for the same component and pick just one, which is 
not what we want here.  Each unique ensemble (or set of equally likely 
candidates) should get its own separate search tab.</p>
<div class="image"><img alt="images/blip_search.png" src="images/blip_search.png" /></div>
<p>At this point we are ready to run Phaser, which should again take only a few
minutes to complete successfully.</p>
