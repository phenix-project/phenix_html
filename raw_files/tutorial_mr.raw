<p>This tutorial shows how to use the <a class="reference" href="phaser_mr.htm">Phaser-MR GUIs</a> to solve
structures by molecular replacement, using example data included with the
Phenix distribution.  We recommend reading the
<a class="reference" href="mr_overview.htm">MR overview</a> before running these tutorials (and for
adventurous users, the primary Phaser reference as well).</p>
<p>A brief word about terminology: the search models used in Phaser are
customarily named &quot;ensembles&quot;, and in fact Phaser may work best in difficult
cases when a set of superposed models (generated using <a class="reference" href="ensembler.htm">Ensembler</a> or similar tools) is used.  However, this is not required
and for easily solved structures, such as the tutorial datasets used here,
a single PDB file will be sufficient.  Furthermore, while Phaser can search
for multiple alternative ensembles and output only the best solution, here we
will use just one candidate per component.</p>
<p>An essential feature of Phaser is that it scores possible solutions based on
the expected crystal composition (that is, the scattering mass).  Therefore,
for the examples shown here, we will be supplying sequence files for the
crystallized proteins.  We could, however, specify the molecular weight or
number of residues instead.  Importantly, the manner in which the composition
is specific is completely decoupled from the &quot;ensemble&quot; (search model) input;
where multiple proteins have been crystallized, we could supply separate
sequence files (as is done here for the beta-blip example) or a single file
with multiple sequences, and the result will be identical.  While it is
technically possible to run Phaser with just a search model and extrapolate
the molecular weight based on the desired number of copies, this is not
recommended.</p>
<P><H5><U><B>Multi-component searches</B></U></H5><P>
<p>The interface for multi-component searches is considerably more complicated,
especially since the ensemble and composition inputs are split up.  The
tutorial data for this example is &quot;TEM-1 Beta-lactamase/beta-lactamaseinhibitor complex&quot; (or &quot;beta-blip&quot;), and includes five files: an MTZ file and
two each of search models and sequence files.</p>
<p>Start the standard Phaser-MR GUI by clicking &quot;Phaser-MR&quot; under the &quot;Molecular
replacement&quot; section.  The first tab that appears defines the experimental
data; click &quot;Browse...&quot; next to the &quot;Data file&quot; field and select the file
named &quot;beta_blip_P3221.mtz&quot;.  The unit cell and space group will be
automatically filled in, and the &quot;Data labels&quot; menu will be populated with
suitable choices (only one in this case).</p>
<div class="image"><img alt="images/beta_blip_1.png" src="images/beta_blip_1.png" /></div>
<p>The maximum-likelihood equations used in Phaser make it unnecessary to
truncate the data to lower resolution in most cases.  The only advantage to
doing this here is that it will significantly decrease the runtime, at the
expense of a less accurate (though still valid) solution.  Other options
should be left alone; since this dataset does not have translational NCS
(TNCS), the checkbox for TNCS support will have no effect.</p>
<p>The second tab, &quot;Ensembles&quot;, is where the search models are entered.  First
we will load the beta-lactamase model: for &quot;Model ID&quot;, enter &quot;beta&quot;, then
click &quot;Add file&quot; below the list widget and select &quot;beta.pdb&quot;.  This will
add it to the list with the &quot;Variance&quot; field blank.  Click the &quot;Change
variance&quot; button, and enter &quot;100&quot; for the sequence identity and click &quot;OK&quot;.</p>
<div class="image"><img alt="images/beta_variance.png" src="images/beta_variance.png" /></div>
<p>The window should now look like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img alt="images/beta_ensemble.png" src="images/beta_ensemble.png" /></div>
<p>At the bottom of the window, click &quot;Add PDB ensemble&quot;.  A second ensemble
sub-tab will appear.  Now repeat the procedure using &quot;beta.pdb&quot; instead.
(The order in which these ensembles are input is technically not important,
because Phaser will normally determine the appropriate search order
automatically.  However, in this case Phaser will indeed search for beta
first, because it is a significantly larger protein.)</p>
<p>The third configuration tab, &quot;Compositon&quot;, is where we tell Phaser what
scattering mass to expect in the crystal.  If we know the exact molecular
weight (or number of residues) of the entire structure, we could simply enter
that here, but we will use sequences instead.  The files &quot;beta.seq&quot; and
&quot;blip.seq&quot; should be input in the &quot;Sequence file&quot; field in successive tabs;
click the button &quot;Add macromolecule(s)&quot; at the bottom of the window to add
a tab.  The number of copies is 1 in both cases.  (Here the order in which the
composition is input really is unimportant.)</p>
<div class="image"><img alt="images/blip_component.png" src="images/blip_component.png" /></div>
<p>The final configuration tab, &quot;Search procedure&quot;, is where we tell Phaser
how to use the ensembles we input, along with several of the most important
search options.  Each search step has its own tab; assuming the ensembles
have been entered appropriately, the tab will initially look like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img alt="images/beta_blip_search.png" src="images/beta_blip_search.png" /></div>
<p>Check &quot;beta&quot;, leaving the number of copies set to 1, then click &quot;Add search&quot;,
and in the new tab, check &quot;blip&quot; (still with 1 copy).  This interface allows
you to check multiple ensembles in a single search, but this would instead
try both and pick just one, which is not what we want here.  Each unique
ensemble (or set of equally likely candidates) should get its own separate
search tab.</p>
<div class="image"><img alt="images/blip_search.png" src="images/blip_search.png" /></div>
<p>The other controls on this tab do not need to modified, but the option for
alternative space groups deserves special mention.  If there is any ambiguity
about the precise space group, for instance, if the data were processed as
P222 but the exact combination of screw axes is unknown, or the space group
could be either P6(1) or P6(5), Phaser can try multiple space groups and
identify the best one at the translation function stage.  The default is to
try only the enantiomeric space group; this will have no effect for beta-blip
(the MTZ file already contains the correct symmetry), but it would be
appropriate for the P6(1) versus P6(5) case.  The most permissive setting is
&quot;All possible in the same pointgroup&quot;.</p>
<p>Now we are ready to run Phaser: click the Run button on the toolbar.  A new
tab will appear with a status panel, a list of warnings, and summary output
(basically excerpted from the log file).  For many structures there will be
one or more warnings, but these do not necessarily mean that Phaser will not
be successful.  This example should finish in several minutes without errors.</p>
<div class="image"><img alt="images/beta_blip_run.png" src="images/beta_blip_run.png" /></div>
<p>Once the run is complete, a results tab will appear, showing a summary of the
solution and output files, with buttons to launch other programs.  The two
statitistics are the log-likelihood gain (LLG), which expresses the
probability of this solution compared to a random-atom model, and the
translation function Z-score, which denotes the signal-to-noise ratio of
the solution.  In this case both are excellent, indicating that Phaser found
an unambiguous solution.</p>
<div class="image"><img alt="images/beta_blip_results.png" src="images/beta_blip_results.png" /></div>
<p>At this point we recommend inspecting the maps and crystal packing in Coot.
Because Phaser only performs rigid-body and group B-factor refinement, the map
quality will most likely be relatively poor compared to a refined map, with
many unexplained difference peaks, but they should still be interpretable
for a correct solution.</p>
<p>The appropriate next step would be either rebuilding or refinement, both of
which can be launched directly from the results tab.  For this example we
could go straight to refinement; if the structure was instead solved using
homologous proteins, running AutoBuild would be a better choice.</p>
