<P><H5>Purpose of the AutoBuild Wizard</H5><P>

<P>The purpose of the AutoBuild Wizard is to provide a highly automated system
for model rebuilding and completion. The Wizard design allows the user to
specify data files and parameters through an interactive GUI, or alternatively
through keyworded scripts. The AutoBuild Wizard begins with datafiles with
structure factor amplitudes and uncertainties, along with either experimental
phase information or a starting model, carries out cycles of model-building
and refinement alternating with model-based density modification, and
producing a relatively complete atomic model. 

<P>The AutoBuild Wizard uses RESOLVE, TEXTAL, xtriage and 
phenix.refine to build an atomic model, refine it, and improve
it with iterative density modification, refinement, and model-building
<P>The Wizard begins with either experimental phases (i.e., from AutoSol)
or with an atomic model that can be used to generate calculated phases.
The AutoBuild Wizard produces a refined model that can be nearly complete
if the data are strong and the resolution is about 2.5 A or better. At
lower resolutions (2.5 - 3 A) the model may be less complete and at 
resolutions > 3A the model may be quite incomplete and not well
refined.
<P> The AutoBuild Wizard can be used to generate OMIT maps (simple omit,
SA-omit, iterative-build omit) that can cover the entire unit cell or
specific residues in a PDB file.
<P> The AutoBuild Wizard can generate a set of models compatible with
experimental data (multiple_models)

      <P><H5><U>Usage</U></H5><P>
<P>The AutoBuild Wizard can be run from the PHENIX GUI, from the command-line, 
and from keyworded script files.  All three versions are identical except
in the way that they take commands from the user. 
See 
<a href="running-wizards.htm">
Running a Wizard from a GUI, the command-line, or a script</a> 
for details of how to run a Wizard.
The command-line version will be described here.
<P>
<P><H5>How the AutoBuild Wizard works:</H5><P>
<P>

<P>The AutoBuild Wizard begins with experimental structure factor amplitudes,
along with either experimental or model-based estimates of crystallographic
phases. The phase information is improved by using statistical density
modification to improve the correlation of NCS-related density in the map (if
present) and to improve the match of the distribution of electron densities in
the map with those expected from a model map. This improved map is then used
to build and refine an atomic model. 

<P>In subsequent cycles, the models from previous cycles are used as a source of
phase information in statistical density modification, iteratively improving
the quality of the map used for model-building. 

<P>Additionally, during the first few cycles additional phase information is
obtained by detecting and enhancing (1) the presence of commonly-found local
patterns of density in the map, and (2) the presence of density in the shape
of helices and strands. The final model obtained is analyzed for residue-based
map correlation and density at the coordinates of individual atoms, and an
analysis including a summary of atoms and residues that are in strong,
moderate, or weak density and out of density is provided.

<P><H5>Automation and user control</H5><P>

<P>The AutoBuild Wizard has been designed for ease of use combined with maximal
user control, with as many parameters set automatically by the Wizard as
possible, but maintaining parameters accessible to the user through a GUI and
through keyword-based scripts. The Wizard uses the input/output routines of
the cctbx library, allowing data files of many different formats so that the
user does not have to convert their data to any particular format before using
the Wizard. Use of the phenix.refine refinement package in the AutoBuild
Wizard allows a high degree of automation of refinement so that the neither
user nor Wizard is required to specify parameters for refinement. The
phenix.refine package automatically includes a bulk solvent model and
automatically places solvent molecules.

<P><H5>Core modules in the AutoBuild Wizard</H5><P>

<P>The five core modules in the AutoBuild Wizard are 
<UL><LI>(1) building a new model into an electron density map 

<LI>(2) rebuilding an existing model 

<LI>(3) refinement 

<LI>(4) iterative model- building beginning from experimental phase
information, and 

<LI>(5) iterative model-building beginning from a model. 
</LI>
</UL>

<P>The standard procedures available in the AutoBuild Wizard that are based on
these modules include: 


<UL><LI>(a) model-building and completion starting from experimental phases, 

<LI>(b) rebuilding a model from scratch, with or without experimental phase
information, and 

<LI>(c) rebuilding a model in place, maintaining connectivity and sequence
register. 
</LI>
</UL>

<P>Starting from a set of experimental phases and structure factor amplitudes,
normally procedure (a) is carried out, and then the resulting model is rebuilt
with procedure (b). 

<P>Starting from a model (e.g., from molecular replacement) and experimental
structure factor amplitudes, procedure (c) is normally carried out if the
starting model differs less than about 5% in sequence from the desired model,
and otherwise procedure (b) is used.

<P>
<P><H5>How to run the AutoBuild Wizard:</H5><P>
<P>  Running the AutoBuild Wizard is easy.  For example, 
from the command-line you can type:
<PRE style="face=courier">phenix.autobuild data=w1.sca seq.dat coords=coords.pdb
</PRE>
<P>The AutoBuild Wizard will carry out iterative model-building,
density modification and refinement based on the data in w1.sca and
the model in coords.pdb, editing the model as necessary to match the
sequence in seq.dat.

<P><H5>What the AutoBuild wizard needs to run:</H5><P>

<UL><LI>(1) a data file, optionally with phases and HL coeffs and freeR flag
    (w1.sca or data=w1.sca)
<LI>(2) a sequence file (seq.dat or seq_file=seq.dat) or a model
(coords.pdb or model=coords.pdb)
</LI>
</UL>


<P><H5>...and optional files:</H5><P>

<UL><LI>(3) coefficients for a starting map (map_file=resolve.mtz)
<LI>(4) a file for refinement (refinement_file=exptl_fobs_freeR_flags.mtz)
<LI>(5) a high-resolution datafile (hires_file=high_res.sca)
</LI>
</UL>



<a name="stdanch1" id="SpecifyingColumns"></a>
<P><H5>Specifying which columns of data to use from input data files</H5><P>
<P>If one or more of your data files has column names that the Wizard
cannot identify automatically, you can specify them yourself. You
will need to provide one column "name" for each expected column of data,
with "None" for anything that is missing.

<P>For example, if your data file ref.mtz has columns FP SIGFP and FreeR
then you might specify
<PRE style="face=courier">refinement_file=ref.mtz
input_refinement_labels="FP SIGFP None None None None None None FreeR"
</PRE>

<P>The keywords for labels and anticipated input labels (program labels) are:

<PRE style="face=courier">input_labels (for data file): FP SIGFP PHIB FOM HLA HLB HLC HLD FreeR_flag
input_refinement_labels: FP SIGFP FreeR_flag
input_map_labels: FP SIGFP PHIB FOM
input_hires_labels: FP SIGFP FreeR_flag
</PRE>

<P>You can find out all the possible label strings in a data file that
you might use by typing:
<PRE style="face=courier">phenix.autosol display_labels=w1.mtz  # display all labels for w1.mtz
</PRE>

<P><H5>Specifying other general parameters</H5><P>
<P>You can specify many more parameters as well. See the list of
keywords, defaults and descriptions at the end of this page and
also general information about running Wizards at
<a href="running-wizards.htm">
Running a Wizard from a GUI, the command-line, or a script</a> 
for how to do this.  Some of the most common parameters are:
<PRE style="face=courier">data=w1.sca       # data file
model=coords.pdb  # starting model
seq_file=seq.dat  # sequence file
map_file=map_coeffs.mtz # coefficients for a starting map for building
resolution=3     # dmin of 3 A
s_annealing=True  # use simulated annealing refinement at start of each cycle
n_cycle_build_max=5  # max number of build cycles (starting from experimental phases)
n_cycle_rebuild_max=5  # max number of rebuild cycles (starting from a model)
</PRE>

<P><H5>Specifying phenix.refine parameters</H5><P>
<P>You can control phenix.refine parameters that are not specified
directly by AutoBuild using a refinement parameters (.eff) file:
<PRE style="face=courier">refine_eff_file=refinement_params.eff    # set any phenix.refine params not set by AutoBuild
</PRE>
Note that any parameters that are set directly by AutoBuild override your 
inputs from the refine_eff_file. These parameters are listed below.

<P>Parameters that are set using AutoBuild Wizard keywords (overwriting
any values provided by user in input_eff_file)

<P>The following parameters controlling phenix.refine output
are set directly in AutoBuild and cannot be set by the user

<LI> refinement.output.write_maps
<LI> refinement.output.write_map_coefficients
</LI>
</UL>


<P><H5>Specifying resolve/resolve_pattern parameters</H5><P>
<P>Similarly, you can control resolve and resolve_pattern parameters. For these
parameters, your inputs will not be overridden by AutoBuild. 
The format is a little tricky: you have to put two sets of 
quotes around the command like this:
<PRE style="face=courier">resolve_command="'resolution 200 3'"    # NOTE ' and " quotes
</PRE>
This will put the text
<PRE style="face=courier">resolution 200 3
</PRE>
at the end of every temporary command file created to run resolve.
(This is why it is not overridden by AutoBuild commands; they will all come 
before your commands in the resolve command file.) Note that 
some commands in resolve may be incompatible with this usage.

<P><H5>Including ligand coordinates in AutoBuild</H5><P>
<P>You can tell AutoBuild to add the contents of any PDB file to the
current version of the structure just before refinement, so all the refined
models produced contain whatever AutoBuild has built, plus the contents of
this PDB file. This can be done through the GUI, the command-line, or
a script. In the command-line version you do this with something like:
<PRE style="face=courier">input_lig_file=my_ligand.pdb
</PRE>
<P>If the PDB file contains a ligand, you may need to tell phenix.refine
about the geometry of this ligand. In that case you will want to run
elbow.builder to create a cif definition file for this ligand:
<PRE style="face=courier">elbow.builder my_ligand.pdb --id=LIG
</PRE>
where LIG is the 3-letter ID code that you use in my_ligand.pdb
to identify your ligand.
<P>Then you can use the keyword "cif_def_files_list" to 
tell AutoBuild about this ligand:
<PRE style="face=courier">cif_def_files_list=elbow.LIG.my_ligand.pdb.cif
</PRE>

<P><H5>Specifying arbitrary commands and cif files for phenix.refine </H5><P>
<P>You can tell AutoBuild to apply any set of cif definitions to the model
during refinement by using a combination of specification files and the
commands cif_def_files_list and refine_eff_file_list:
<PRE style="face=courier">refine_eff_file_list=link.eff cif_def_file_list=link.cif
</PRE>
This example comes from the phenix.refine manual page in which a link is 
specified in a cif definition file link.cif:
<PRE style="face=courier"> data_mod_5pho

_chem_mod_atom.mod_id

<P>and this is applied with a parameters file link.eff:
<PRE style="face=courier"> refinement.pdb_interpretation.apply_cif_modification
{
  data_mod = 5pho
  residue_selection = resname GUA and name O5T
}
</PRE>
<P>You can have any number of cif files and parameters files.

This procedure is useful for generating an ensemble of models that are

      <P><H5><U>Possible Problems</U></H5><P>

<P><H5>General limitations:</H5><P>


<UL><LI>The AutoBuild model-building can only build one type of chain at a 
time (default chain_type='PROTEIN'; other choices are RNA and DNA).  If you
supply a PDB file containing more than one type of chain for rebuilding, 
then all the residues that are not that type of chain are ignored.  
<P>You can include more than one type of chain in rebuilding by supplying 
one type of chains as ligands with input_lig_file and rebuilding another
type:
<PRE style="face=courier">chain_type=PROTEIN  # build only protein
input_lig_file=MyDNA.pdb  # just read in DNA coordinates and include in refinement
</PRE>
In this case only protein chains will be built, but the DNA coordinates in
MyDNA.pdb will be included in all refinements and will be written out
to the final coordinate file.  This process may require some editing of the
PDB files by hand because when you use the input_lig_file procedure, any
atoms in the input_lig_file that overlap with an atom built automatically
are skipped. This means that if protein chains are accidentally built in the
region where DNA is located, then these incorrect protein chains will remain
and some of the DNA atoms will not be written out.

</LI>
</UL>

<P><H5>Specific limitations and problems:</H5><P>


<UL><LI>The size of the asymmetric unit in the SOLVE/RESOLVE portion of 
the AutoBuild wizard is limited by the memory in your computer and the
binaries used. The Wizard is supplied with regular-size ("", size=6), 
giant ("_giant", size=12), huge ("_huge", size=18) and extra_huge
("_extra_huge", size=36).  Larger-size versions can be obtained on
request.

<LI>The AutoBuild Wizard can take most settings of most space groups,
however it can only use the hexagonal setting of rhombohedral space groups 
(eg., #146 R3:H or #155 R32:H), and it cannot use space groups 114-119 (not
found in macromolecular crystallography) even in the standard setting 
due to difficulties with the use of asuset in the version of ccp4 libraries 
used in PHENIX for these settings and space groups.

<LI>The PHENIX Wizards will automatically read some parameters from
previous runs of the same and any other Wizard in the same directory. 
The parameters that are set this way are:
</UL>
<PRE style="face=courier">chain_type
dmin 
expt_type 
find_ncs 
input_seq_file 
ligand_solutions 
mad_ha_type 
mask_type 
ncs_copies 
residues 
resolution 
semet 
solvent_fraction 
thorough_denmod 
truncate_ha_sites_in_resolve 
use_met_in_align
</PRE>

Setting defaults for these parameters in this way is usually helpful, but 
if you set them in one run it is important to keep in mind that the value 
you have set them to will become the default for future runs in that 
directory (unless you delete that run).  If there are multiple runs 
in which a parameter is set, then the one that was started last sets 
the default for that parameter.
