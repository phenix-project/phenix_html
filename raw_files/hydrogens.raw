<p><strong>Purpose</strong></p>
<p>phenix.reduce is a command line tool for adding hydrogens to a PDB
structure file. Hydrogens are added in standardized geometry with optimization
of the orientations of OH, SH, NH3+, Met methyls, Asn and Gln sidechain amides,
and His rings. Both proteins and nucleic acids can be processed. HET groups can
also be processed as long as the atom connectivity is provided. The program is
described in Word, et al.(1999). J. Mol. Biol. 285, 1733-1745. For more

<p><strong>How to run</strong></p>
<p>phenix.reduce is run from the command line:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
% phenix.reduce [pdb_file] [options]
</pre>
<p><strong>To get information about command line options type</strong>:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
% phenix.reduce
</pre>
<p>or for a longer list:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
% phenix.reduce -h
</pre>

<p>Please refer to phenix.refine documentation to see how hydrogen atoms are used
in structure refinement.</p>
