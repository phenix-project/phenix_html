<p>If you already have map coefficients in an MTZ file and have identified
your NCS with 
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">phenix.find_ncs</span></tt>
and just want to calculate the average density in all your NCS copies, you
can use 
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">phenix.ncs_average</span></tt>.
 
In most cases this can be run automatically by passing the name of the MTZ file and
the ncs_spec file with NCS information.
<P>
The output of <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">phenix.ncs_average</span></tt> is a CCP4-style map file.

<P>
These simple NCS averaged maps can be accurate maps for cases with high NCS 
symmetry and they are useful for evaluating what an NCS density modified 
map should be expected to look like.
