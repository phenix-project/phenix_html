<P><H5><U>Purpose</U></H5><P>

morph_model is a procedure for distorting a model to match an 
electron density map. It is suited for a case where a poor but unbiased
map is available and a model that is generally
locally similar to the target structure but where longer-range distances
are not conserved.  This is often the case in homologous structures.


<P><H5><U>Summary of the procedure used in morph_model </U></H5><P>
The basic idea in morph_model is to apply a smoothly-varying offset to the
template structure so as to make it match the map as closely as possible. In
this way information about the local structure of the template is retained
while allowing longer-range changes in structure.
</P>
<P>Morphing is carried out in 3 steps:
<UL>
<LI>For each residue in the structure an offset is identified that optimizes
the match of the map to a sphere of atoms within rad_morph (typically 6 A)
of the CA atom of that residue.  </LI>
<LI>The offsets are smoothed in a window of 10 residues</LI>
<LI>The smoothed offset for each residue is applied to all the atoms in that
residue
</UL>
</P>
<P>After morphing, the morphed model is refined.  This process is
then repeated morph_cycles (typically 6) times.</P>

<P><H5>Maps for morph_model</H5><P>
Normally you should specify that morph-model use a prime-and-switch
map (map_type=prime_and_switch), as that is usually the most effective
map for morphing. You can however choose instead to use a 2mFo-DFc map,
a density-modified map, or an omit map.  The prime-and-switch map is a
map calculated in the same way as a density-modified map, except that
once the initial model-based map is calculated (priming), the 
model information is no longer used (switching). This map is typically
quite unbiased by the model.

<P><H5>Standard run of morph_model</H5><P>

<p>Running morph_model is easy. 
If you have a template (coords1.pdb) and a
 data file fobs.mtz with FP SIGFP and FreeR_flag,  you can type:

<PRE style="face=courier">
phenix.morph_model data=coords1.mtz model=coords1.pdb 
</PRE>
and morph_model will run automatically.

<P><H5>Supplying a map for  morph_model</H5><P>

<p>If you have your own map you want to use in morph_model, you can type:

<PRE style="face=courier">
phenix.morph_model data=coords1.mtz \
   model=coords1.pdb map_coeffs=my_map_coeffs.mtz
</PRE>
and morph_model will start off with your map coefficients instead of 
calculating a new map.  If you specify update_map=True (default) then
new maps will be calculated on each subsequent cycle. If you specify
update_map=False then your map will be used throughout.

<P><H5>Morphing just part of a model</H5><P>
You can morph just one part of your model if you want.  
You can specify it like this:
<PRE style="face=courier">
phenix.morph_model data=coords1.mtz \
   model=coords1.pdb morph_selection="chain A"
</PRE>
The remainder of the model will be refined but not morphed.  
</P>

<P><H5>Getting a default parameters file for morph_model</H5><P>
<p>Usually you will want to edit a parameters file so that you can specify more
details of the run. You can get a default parameters file with:
<PRE style="face=courier">phenix.morph_model 
</PRE>
and then just edit the file morph_model_params.dat.
