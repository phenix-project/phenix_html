<p>You should obtain the latest distribution of PHENIX including the
binary bundles for your machine architectures. Unpack the tar file:</p>
<pre>
% tar xvf phenix-installer-&lt;version&gt;-&lt;platform&gt;.tar
</pre>
<p>Change to the installer directory:</p>
<pre>
% cd phenix-installer-&lt;version&gt;
</pre>
<p>To install:</p>
<pre>
% ./install       [will install in /usr/local/phenix-&lt;version&gt; by default,
                   requires root permissions]

% ./install --prefix=&lt;directory&gt;  [will make &lt;directory&gt;/phenix-&lt;version&gt; and install there]
</pre>
<p>Note: &lt;directory&gt; must be a absolute path (i.e. starts with a /). A
relative path starting with ../ will not work correctly.</p>
<p>Note: on Mac OS-X systems the binary installation must be installed in /usr/local. </p>

<p>Installation of the binary version of PHENIX requires no compilation, only 
the generation of some data files, so you will probably have to wait about 
30 minutes for the installation to complete (depending on the performance of
your installation platform).</p>

<p>PHENIX is supported on most common Linux platforms and Mac OS-X.  The
binary installers are built on Fedora Core 3 (intel-linux-2.6), Fedora Core 8
(intel-linux-2.6-x86_64), and Mac OS 10.4.11 (mac-intel-osx).  Nightly tests
of the undlerying components are run on additional systems.  In most cases
the binary installers should run without problems on other Linux distributions
such as Ubuntu or SuSE.  Kernels prior to 2.6 are not supported.</p>

<p>Only 32-bit objects are supported on Macintosh due to limitations of the
GUI libraries.  For Linux, there is a choice of 32-bit and 64-bit installers;
please select the installer appropriate to your architecture and OS.  You
can find out what platform you are running with the command 'uname -p';
for machines reporting "i686", use the intel-linux-2.6 installer.</p>

<p>For license information please see <tt><span class="pre">LICENSE</span></tt> file.</p>
<p>For source of components see <tt><span class="pre">SOURCES</span></tt>.</p>
