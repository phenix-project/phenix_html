<p>Molecular replacement (MR) is a phasing method that uses prior information in
the form of a related or homologous structure.  The procedure is roughly
divided into two steps, a <strong>rotation function</strong> (RF) to determine the
orientation of the search model(s), and a <strong>translation function</strong> (TF) to
determine the absolute position(s) in the unit cell.  Because it requires no
additional experimental procedures or data, and additionally simplifies
model-building, MR is usually the method of choice for structure determination
when a suitable search model is available.  (See the <em>Limitations</em> section
below for advice on search models.)</p>
<p>In PHENIX, MR is performed by the program <a class="reference" href="phaser.htm">Phaser</a>, written by
Randy Read's group at the University of Cambridge.  Although Phaser may be run
on the command line with CCP4-style inputs, we recommend using either the
<a class="reference" href="automr_gui.htm">AutoMR</a> wizard (GUI or <a class="reference" href="automr.htm">command line</a>), or
the <a class="reference" href="phaser_mr.htm">Phaser-MR GUI</a>.  AutoMR presents a user-friendly and
automated frontend to Phaser, and interfaces directly with the <a class="reference" href="autobuild.htm">AutoBuild
wizard</a> for model-building.  We recommend that new users,
and anyone who expects MR to work for their specific structure, start with the
AutoMR GUI.  The Phaser-MR GUI is more complex, but enables finer control over
parameters and multi-step searches, which may be necessary for difficult
structures.  The <a class="reference" href="sculptor.htm">Sculptor</a> and <a class="reference" href="ensembler.htm">Ensembler</a>
utilities are available for preparing search models.</p>
<p>(Phaser is also used for experimental phasing, but this functionality is
exposed through the <a class="reference" href="autosol.htm">AutoSol wizard</a> and <a class="reference" href="phaser_ep.htm">Phaser-EP GUI</a>.)</p>
<P><H5><U><B>Input files and mandatory parameters</B></U></H5><P>
<p>All of the MR programs in PHENIX require a single reflections file containing
experimental data (with sigmas); AutoMR and the GUI will accept any file format
or data type, including intensities.  The procedure traditionally uses all
reflections, so R-free flags are not required.  (Unlike refinement, this does
not severely bias the final R-free value, since the placement of molecules
will be approximate and some conformational changes usually occur.)</p>
<p>At least one search model is required.  In most cases this will be a PDB file
containing a partial structure.  For more variable structures, an ensemble
model may be used instead - either a PDB file with multiple MODEL records, or
multiple similar PDB files.  When using an ensemble, all models must be
superposed in the same orientation; the <a class="reference" href="ensembler.htm">Ensembler</a> utility
is used for this.    There are no limitations on the size or number of search
models.  For large complexes, if the relative positions of individual subunits
do not change, the entire assembly may be used as a search model instead of
placing each component separately.  All heteroatoms (ligands and waters)
should be removed from the PDB file(s) before use.</p>
<p>Another option, only available in Phaser itself (not
AutoMR), is to search using a map (or rather, an MTZ file containing
pre-weighted map coefficients), often solved at low resolution.  This
requires additional information about the center and extent of the map section
to search with.</p>
<p>The maximum likelihood phasing methods used in Phaser require prior knowledge
about the deviation (or variance) of the search model(s) from the real
structure, and the expected composition or scattering mass of the crystal.  To
specify the model variance, either an RMSD value or percent sequence identity
may be used (these will be converted internally, and a sequence identity of
100% is assumed to mean an approximate RMSD of 1.0A).  It is important to
minimize the variance if possible (see <em>Limitations</em> below for guidelines),
which often requires eliminating atoms or modifying B-factors.  The <a class="reference" href="sculptor.htm">Sculptor</a> utility will perform this step, given a PDB file and a
sequence alignment.  (This is usually unnecessary for search models with high
sequence identity to the target molecule.)</p>
<p>For composition, you may supply a sequence file (protein or nucleic acid), or
simply enter the molecular weight.  The standalone versions of Phaser also
accept the fractional composition of each search ensemble, if known.
Note that the composition data does not necessarily have
a 1:1 correspondence with the search ensembles (see FAQ list below for
details).  Even if you are only searching for a single
ensemble out of several (e.g. the protein in a protein-DNA complex), you
must still supply the expected composition of the entire crystal.</p>
<P><H5><U><B>Outline of MR procedure</B></U></H5><P>
<p>The automated molecular replacement method in Phaser involves several discrete
steps:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Anisotropy correction</strong>: scales reflections as necessary to overcome
anisotropy (weak data in a particular direction).</li>
<li><strong>Rotation function</strong>: identifies orientation of model(s).</li>
<li><strong>Translation function</strong>: given the orientation(s) from the RF, finds the
absolute position(s) in the unit cell.</li>
<li><strong>Packing analysis</strong>: filters TF results based on number of clashes
between atoms, given a certain cutoff.  (By default, this uses a very
conservative cutoff, which may not be ideal for searching with distant
homologues.)</li>
<li><strong>Refinement and phasing</strong>: performs simple rigid-body refinement of the
placed molecules, and calculates phases from the final solution.</li>
<li><strong>Log-likelihood gain calculation</strong>: determines the final LLG, which can
be used to evaluate the success of MR.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>If multiple search models are used, these steps will be performed sequentially
for each model.  Although each step may be run individually in the Phaser-MR
GUI, this is necessary only in exceptionally difficult cases.</p>
<P><H5><U><B>Limitations</B></U></H5><P>
<p>The main restriction on the use of molecular replacement is the requirement
for a suitably similar search model.  Although there is no exact rule for this,
the relationship between sequence identity and MR success is roughly as
follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Better than 40% identity</strong>: usually easy, unless large conformational
changes are involved.</li>
<li><strong>30-40%</strong>: MR possible, but sometimes more difficult.</li>
<li><strong>20-30%</strong>: MR difficult, careful model preparation required.</li>
<li><strong>Less than 20%</strong>: MR unlikely to work in most cases.</li>
<li>In terms of RMSD, above 2.5A is very unlikely to work, while 1.5A or less
is preferrable.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Structures which undergo large conformational changes may need to be split
into separate domains for searching, regardless of sequence identity.  Where
multiple similar search models are available, combining these into an ensemble
may improve the likelihood of success.  Processing models with the <a class="reference" href="sculptor.htm">Sculptor</a> utility is highly recommended, especially at lower sequence
identity.</p>
<p>Additional problems include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Low resolution; although MR often works best with a reduced set of
reflections, the assumption is that these are measured very accurately,
which is not the case when the overall resolution limit is already 4A or
worse.</li>
<li>Packing clashes due to model deviations and/or extra residues.  This can
result in an otherwise valid solution being thrown out.  Removing the
offending residues or lowering the packing cutoff can circumvent the
problem.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>For cases where anomalous data from a SAD experiment are available, a poor
(but genuine) MR solution may be used to identify heavy-atom sites and
combined with SAD phases, a technique known as MR-SAD.  This may provide a
decent-quality map where neither technique is independently sufficient.  The
AutoMR and AutoSol manuals have details on running this in Phenix.</p>

<P><H5><U><B>Frequently Asked Questions</B></U></H5><P>
<p>Note that most of these questions apply mainly to the &quot;automated molecular
replacement&quot; (MR_AUTO) mode of Phaser.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>How do I know if Phaser has solved my structure?</strong>  This is answered in
detail in the section &quot;Has Phaser solved it?&quot; in the <a class="reference" href="phaser.htm">main Phaser manual</a>, but it can be summarized as follows: the final translation
function Z score (TFZ) should be above 8, and the log-likelihood gain
(LLG) should be positive and as high as possible.  Of course, as with
experimental phasing, the ability to <a class="reference" href="autobuild.htm">autobuild most of the model</a> is the single best measure of a correct solution;
alternately, running a single round of <a class="reference" href="refine_gui.htm">refinement</a>
should result in an R-free below 0.50.</li>
<li><strong>Why doesn't Phaser report an R-factor?</strong>  The R-factor is far less
sensitive than the TFZ and LLG scores, especially when searching for
remote homologs or a small part of the overall scattering mass.  Phaser
does record R-factors for the rigid-body refinement step towards the
end of a run, which can be found in the logfile.  However, unless these
values are relatively low (&lt; 40%), they are not reliable indicators of
solution quality, which is why only the Z-scores and LLG are reported in
the GUI.</li>
<li><strong>What if I don't get a good solution?</strong> This is also covered in detail
in the <a class="reference" href="phaser.htm">main Phaser manual</a>, in the section &quot;What to do in
difficult cases&quot;.</li>
<li><strong>What resolution cutoff should I use?</strong>  By default Phaser uses all
data to 2.5 A.  We recommend leaving the resolution alone, but in some
cases reducing it may improve results (it will also lead to a significant
improvement in speed).  The effects of bulk solvent at low resolution are
already taken into account internally, so you do not need to specify
a low-resolution cutoff either.</li>
<li><strong>Should I use the output MTZ file from Phaser for refinement?</strong> No, the
amplitudes (Fs) in this file have been corrected for anisotropy, which is
helpful for the MR search but may significantly alter them from the
experimental values.  The MTZ file is only useful for map coefficients,
but in most cases you will find that much better maps can be obtained by
immediately running a round of refinement or automated re-building.</li>
<li><strong>How are the composition and search ensembles related?</strong>  Technically,
they aren't connected.  The ensembles are used in the actuall MR search;
the composition only tells Phaser what to expect for the overall scattering
mass of the asymmetric unit (an important factor in the maximum likelihood
scoring).  Although you may only specify one sequence per component, you
can instead provide a molecular weight for a collection of chains.  You
may also split a model into smaller ensembles (for instance, different
domains) while keeping the composition the same, or use a multi-chain
search model while specifying a sequence file for each chain.</li>
<li><strong>How can I make Phaser go faster?</strong> The new MR_FAST mode will reduce the
redundancy of multi-copy TF searches, and can significantly reduce overall
runtime.  In many cases, adjusting the resolution limit will dramatically
increase speed, at some cost to accuracy (depending largely on model
similarity).</li>
