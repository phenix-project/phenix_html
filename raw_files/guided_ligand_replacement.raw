<p>The Guided Ligand Replacement (GLR) tool is designed to use prior
knowledge from a previously fit ligand to expedite the fitting of a
&quot;similar&quot; ligand into the same or &quot;similar&quot; protein. The similarity
required between the pair of ligands can be as little as a few atoms.</p>
<p>The proteins are overlayed using <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">phenix.superpose_pdbs</span></tt>. The ligands
are matched using the electronic Ligand Builder and Optimization
Workbench (eLBOW) via another tool called <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">phenix.superpose_ligands</span></tt>. 
Once the ligand has been fit, a Real-Space Refinement (RSR) is
performed and the final model written to disk.</p>

<P><H5><U><B>Input files</B></U></H5><P>
<p>GLR requires a number of inputs and also has some options, all of which
are provided using the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">phil</span></tt> formalism. The list of
required inputs:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>guide_pdb_file_name</strong>: this is a PDB file containing a model-ligand
model.</li>
<li><strong>protein_pdb_file_name</strong>: this is a file containing the protein
model of current interest into which the ligand is to be fit.</li>
<li><strong>map_coeffs_file_name</strong>: this is a maps coefficients file output from
a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">phenix.refine</span></tt> run.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The input for the ligand can be any input file that is readable by eLBOW.
Either or both of the following phil parameters can be used.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>ligand_input_file_name</strong>: this is a file containing chemical information
about the ligand.</li>
<li><strong>ligand_cif_file_name</strong>: this is the
of a ligand restraints file for the RSR step. If not supplied, the 
restraints are generated from <strong>ligand_input_file_name</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>ligand_code</strong>: the ligand code from the PDB Chemical Components so that
restraints and geometry can be generated.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Optional inputs include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>ligand_selection_in_guide_model</strong>: this selects a ligand in the guiding
model. While GLR tries to make a sensible selection based on ligand code
or uniqueness, it may be necessary to make an explicit selection.</li>
<li><strong>phenix.superpose_pdbs</strong>: this allows selection of the same parameters
as in the standalone program.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>By default, GLR will generate a PDB file with the fit ligand.</p>
