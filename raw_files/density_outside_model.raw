<P><H5><U>Purpose</U></H5><P>

This routine takes a model and map coefficients and returns new map coefficients
with density set to zero near the atoms in the model

<P><H5><U>Usage</U></H5><P>
The main uses of phenix.density_outside_model are:
<UL>
<LI>Creating a map where all the parts of the map that have been 
explained by a model are removed.
</UL>

<P><H5>How density_outside_model works:</H5><P>

Density_outside_model calculates a map from the map coefficients. Then all 
map values at points near an atom in the model are set to zero. Then a new
set of map coefficients is calulated and written out.
<P>
Optionally the model can be trimmed so that that the last n_trim residues
in each segment of the model are not included.

<P><H5>Standard run of density_outside_model:</H5><P>

  Running density_outside_model is easy. From the command-line you can
type:
<PRE style="face=courier">phenix.density_outside_model pdb_in=mask_pdb.pdb \
   map_coeffs.mtz
</PRE>
