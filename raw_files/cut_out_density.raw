<P><H5><U>Purpose</U></H5><P>

This routine cuts density out of a map and writes an MTZ file 
      in space group P1 with map coefficients for the cutout density. 
      The density map is calculated from map coefficients supplied as an input MTZ 
      file.  The region to be cut out is specified through the center of the 
      region and dimensions in X Y and Z of a box to be cut out 
      (cutout_center=X,Y,Z and cutout_dimensions=a,b,c). 
      Alternatively the region can be specified with a PDB file and optional 
      atom selections, with all points within a specified radius of an atom 
      included, or the region can be specified with a center and the radius 
      of a sphere to include.
      The density in the region cut out can optionally be offset to have a mean 
      density of zero.  The region outside the cut out region always will have a 
      density of zero.
      The cut out region can be optionally padded with flat density an 
      additional distance beyond the box that is cut out (padding=xx). 
      The resolution of the cutout map can also be specified (the input map 
      will be truncated at the high-resolution limit specified, 
      and the output map will extend to the high-resolution limit.)

<P><H5><U>Usage</U></H5><P>
The main uses of phenix.cut_out_density are:
<UL>
<LI>Cutting out a small part of a map and molecule to work on independently of 
the rest of the structure. This can be useful if you have a very large 
structure, as working with a small piece may be much quicker.  Note that you
can only carry out real-space methods on the extracted map and model.
<LI>Cutting density out of a map to use in molecular replacement.
</UL>
Please note: you should not use phenix.cut_out_density to select regions near
your model for display purposes.  You can create a highly 
misleading map by displaying only density that is within a small radius of
atoms in your model.

<P><H5>How cut_out_density works:</H5><P>

cut_out_density assumes that you are supplying map coefficients and calculates
a map. Then it creates a new unit cell in space group P1 with orthogonal axes
and dimensions big enough for your cut out region and padding of zero density
around it.  The density in your map at the center you specify is then
centered at the origin in the new map. Then new map coefficients are created 
and written out. 

<P>You can optionally specify the region to be cut out as a box, a sphere,
or a region defined by all points within a specified distance of atoms in
a PDB file. 

<P> You can specify the center of the region to be cut out with its 
coordinates, or as the centroid of a PDB file that is input.

<P> If you specify an input PDB file, you can use a selection string to
select any part of that model (i.e., one domain or one chain) as the
region to be cut out or as the center of the cut out region.

<P> If you specify an input PDB file, then the selected atoms from that file
will be offset to match the new map and written out.

<P> As a convenience, you can re-transform a PDB file back to the original
position in your original model as well.
