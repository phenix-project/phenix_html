<p><H5><U>Introduction</U></H5></p><p>

This tutorial will start with a molecular replacement model for
a2u-globulin, and carry out the process of rebuilding this model
using the rebuild-in-place option of the AutoBuild Wizard.
The tutorial is designed to be read all the way through,
giving pointers for you along the way. Once you have read it all and run
the example data and looked at the output files, you will be in 
a good position to run your own data through AutoBuild.

</p><p><H5><U>Setting up to run PHENIX</U></H5></p><p>
If PHENIX is already installed and your environment is all set, then
if you type:
</p><PRE style="face=courier">echo $PHENIX</PRE>
then you should get back something like this:
</p><PRE style="face=courier">/xtal//phenix-1.3b</PRE>
If instead you get:
</p><PRE style="face=courier">PHENIX: undefined variable</PRE>
then you need to set up your PHENIX environment. See the
<a href="install.htm" >PHENIX installation</a> page for 
details of how to do this. 
If you are using the C-shell environment (<b>csh</b>) then all you will need 
to do is add one line to your <b>.cshrc</b> (or equivalent) file that
looks like this:
</p><PRE style="face=courier">source /xtal/phenix-1.3b/phenix_env</PRE>
(except that the path in this statement will be where <b>your</b> PHENIX is
installed). Then the next time you log in <b>$PHENIX</b> will be defined.




</p><p><H5><U>Running the demo a2u-globulin-rebuild data with AutoBuild</U></H5></p><p>
To run AutoBuild on the demo a2u-globulin-rebuild data, make yourself a <b>tutorials</b>
directory and <b>cd</b> into that directory:
</p><PRE style="face=courier">mkdir tutorials
cd tutorials </PRE>
Now  type the phenix command:
</p><PRE style="face=courier">phenix.run_example --help </PRE>
to list the available examples.  Choosing <b>a2u-globulin-rebuild</b> for this
tutorial, you can now use the phenix command:
</p><PRE style="face=courier">phenix.run_example a2u-globulin-rebuild </PRE>
to build the a2u-globulin-rebuild structure with AutoBuild. This command will
copy the directory <b>$PHENIX/examples/a2u-globulin-rebuild</b>
to your current directory (<b>tutorials</b>) 
and call it <b>tutorials/a2u-globulin-rebuild/</b>
. Then it will run AutoBuild using the command file 
<b>run.csh</b> 
that is present in this <b>tutorials/a2u-globulin-rebuild/</b> directory.
</p><p>This command file <b>run.csh</b> is simple. It says:

</p><PRE style="face=courier">
#!/bin/csh
echo "Running AutoBuild on a2u-globulin MR data "
phenix.autobuild mup_mr_solution.pdb a2u-sigmaa.mtz a2u-globulin.seq  \
input_map_file=a2u-sigmaa.mtz input_map_labels="FWT PHIC"

</PRE>
The first line (<b>#!/bin/csh</b>) tells the system 
to interpret the remainder of the text in
the file using the C-shell (<b>csh</b>).</p><p>
The command <b>phenix.autobuild</b> runs the 
command-line version of AutoBuild (see 
<a href="autobuild.htm">Automated Structure Solution using AutoBuild</a> for
all the details about AutoBuild including a full list of keywords).

</p><p>
The arguments on the command line 
tell AutoBuild about the 
molecular replacement model (<b>mup_mr_solution.pdb </b>
the data file (<b>data=a2u-sigmaa.mtz</b>),
sequence file  
(<b>seq_file=a2u-globulin.seq</b>), 
the input map file with sigmaA-weighted phases 
(same as the input data file, but using
different data columns: <b>input_map_file=a2u-sigmaa.mtz</b>), 
and the data columns for the map calculation:
<b>input_map_labels="FWT PHIC"</b>).  (Note that each of these is
specified with an <b>=</b> sign, and that there are no spaces
around the <b>=</b> sign.)

</p><p>Note the backslash &quot;\&quot; at the end of some of the lines in the
<b>phenix.autobuild</b> command. This tells the C-shell (which interprets
everything in this file) that the next line is a continuation of the
current line. There must be no characters (not even a space) after
the backslash for this to work.</p>
</p><p>The structure factor amplitudes and experimental phase information 
are in the datafile <b>a2u-sigmaa.mtz</b>. 
This is an <b>mtz</b> file which is a 
binary file that contains summary information about the dataset as well as the
reflection data.
 
</p><p>Although the <b>phenix.run_example a2u-globulin-rebuild</b> command has just run
AutoBuild from a script (<b>run.csh</b>), you can run AutoBuild yourself from
the command line with the same <b>phenix.autobuild ...</b> command.
You can also run AutoBuild from a GUI, or by putting commands in another
type of script file. All these possibilities are described in 
<a href="running-wizards.htm">
Running a Wizard from a GUI, the command-line, or a script</a>.
</p>

</p><p><H5>Where are my files?</H5></p><p>
Once you have started AutoBuild or another Wizard, an 
<b>output directory</b> will
be created in your current (working) directory. The first time you run
AutoBuild in this directory, this <b>output directory</b> will be
called <b>AutoBuild_run_1_</b> (or <b>AutoBuild_run_1_/</b>, where the slash at
the end just indicates that this is a directory).  All of the output
from run <b>1</b> of AutoBuild will be in this directory. If you run 
AutoBuild again, a new subdirectory called <b>AutoBuild_run_2_</b> will be created.
<p>Inside the directory <b>AutoBuild_run_1_</b> there will be one or more
temporary directories such as <b>TEMP0</b> created while the Wizard is
running. The files in this temporary directory may be useful sometimes in
figuring out what the Wizard is doing (or not doing!). By default these
directories are emptied when the Wizard finishes (but you can keep their
contents with the command <b>clean_up=False</b> if you want.)
</p>

</p><p><H5>What parameters did I use?</H5></p><p>
Once the AutoBuild wizard has started (when run from the command line), a 
<b>parameters file</b>
called <b>autobuild.eff</b> will be created in your <b>output directory</b>
(e.g., <b>AutoBuild_run_1_/autobuild.eff</b>).  This <b>parameters file</b>
has a header that says what command you used to run AutoBuild, and it contains
all the starting values of all parameters for this run (including the 
defaults for all the parameters that you did not set).
</p>
The <b>autobuild.eff</b> file is good for more than just looking at the
values of parameters, though. If you copy this file to a new one
(for example <b>autobuild_lores.eff</b>) and edit it to change the values of
some of the parameters (<b>resolution=3.0</b>) then you can re-run
AutoBuild with the new values of your parameters like this:
</p><PRE style="face=courier">phenix.autobuild autobuild_lores.eff</PRE>
This command will do everything just the same as in your first run but
use only the data to 3.0 A.
</p>

<p><H5><I>Reading the log files for your AutoBuild run file</I></H5></p>
<p>
While the AutoBuild wizard is running, there are several places you can
look to see what is going on. The most important one is the overall
log file for the AutoBuild run. This log file is located in:
</p><PRE style="face=courier">AutoBuild_run_1_/AutoBuild_run_1_1.log</PRE>
for run <b>1</b> of AutoBuild.  (The second <b>1</b> in this log file
name will be incremented if you stop this run in the middle and
restart it with a command like <b>phenix.autobuild run=1</b>).</p>
<p>
The <b>AutoBuild_run_1_1.log</b> file is a running summary of what the
AutoBuild Wizard is doing.  Here are a few of the key sections of the log
files produced for the <b>a2u-globulin-rebuild</b> SAD dataset.
</p>

<p><H5> Summary of the command-line arguments</H5></p>
<p>  Near the top of the log file 
you will find:
</p><PRE style="face=courier"> 
Starting AutoBuild with the command:

phenix.autobuild input_pdb_file=mup_mr_solution.pdb data=a2u-sigmaa.mtz   \
seq_file=a2u-globulin.seq input_map_file=a2u-sigmaa.mtz   \
input_map_labels='FWT PHIC'

Guessing mup_mr_solution.pdb is a starting model.
Guessing a2u-sigmaa.mtz is a datafile.
Guessing a2u-globulin.seq is sequence file.

</PRE>
<p>The first couple lines are just a repeat of how you ran AutoBuild; 
you can copy it and paste them
into the command line to repeat this run.
</p><p>The last 3 lines point out that you didn't specify exacly what these
three files are...and is confirming what the Wizard is going to use them for.
</p>

<p><H5>Guessing the chain type</H5></p>
<p>
The AutoBuild Wizard will read in your sequence file and guess whether this is
PROTEIN, DNA, or RNA from the sequence:
</p><PRE style="face=courier">
Guessing chain type from  a2u-globulin.seq
Setting chain type to  PROTEIN
</PRE>
If you want to tell the Wizard what the chain type is, you can say, <b>chain_type=PROTEIN</b>.

<p><H5>Deciding on rebuild-in-place and editing input PDB file</H5></p>
<p>The AutoBuild Wizard has two main options for rebuilding a model: 
rebuild-in-place and not rebuilding in place. Rebuilding in place is a 
method for rebuilding a model without changing the overall positioning
of residues or the alignment of the sequence in the model.  It is carried 
out by sequentially removing a short segment and rebuilding just that
segment, and keeping the sequence of the segment the same.  The alternative
method for model rebuilding is to start from scratch and build a model 
directly into the electron density map. (Optionally you can also re-use
fragments of your original model.).
</p><p>The AutoBuild Wizard by default will decide whether to use rebuild-in-place
based on whether an alignment of the sequence you input with the model you 
input can be made.  If the sequence alignment yields at least 50% identical
residues, then rebuild-in-place will be recommended. (You can choose
not to use rebuild in place with the keyword <b>rebuild_in_place=No</b>).
</p><p>Rebuilding in place is generally a good idea if you just want to
fix up a model that is almost correct; it is not a good way to make a lot
of big changes in a model.  It will not fill in loops or otherwise
correct connectivity.
</p><p>In this example the sequence identity is high and rebuilding in
place is recommended. The Wizard then edits your PDB file to give it the
sequence you have provided (if you provide no sequence then the sequence
int the PDB file will be kept), deleting any segments that do not match
your sequence file at all, and inserting gaps where there are missing
residues:
</p><PRE style="face=courier">
Deciding if we want to use rebuild-in-place...

Rebuild in place recommended as identity * fraction_aligned is 63.06%

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Percent identity of  mup_mr_solution.pdb to sequence in  a2u-globulin.seq  is  63.06
Finished with creating edited pdb file: AutoBuild_run_1_/edited_pdb.pdb

</PRE>



<p><H5>Guessing column labels</H5></p>
<p>
The AutoBuild Wizard will need to know which columns in your input data file and your input
map file to use. It guesses which column labels to use and lists them out:

</p><PRE style="face=courier">
Getting column labels from a2u-sigmaa.mtz for input data file
Resolution from datafile: 2.38339035134
SG: P 21 21 21
Cell: [106.81999969482422, 62.340000152587891, 114.19000244140625, 90.0, 90.0, 90.0]
Input labels: ['FP', 'SIGFP', 'None', 'FOM', 'None', 'None', 'None', 'None', 'None']

Getting column labels from a2u-sigmaa.mtz for input map file
SG: P 21 21 21
Cell: [106.81999969482422, 62.340000152587891, 114.19000244140625, 90.0, 90.0, 90.0]
Map input labels: ['FWT', 'PHIC']

</PRE>
These are indeed the appropriate columns to use for experimental phases and for map
coefficients, respectively. Note the &quot;None&quot; in the input labels for 
<b>a2u-sigmaa.mtz</b>. 
The input labels in this list correspond to <b>FP SIGFP PHIB FOM HLA HLB HLC HLC FreeR_flag</b> and
there is no Free R data in the input data file.  All the data that is expected for
each input file in AutoBuild can be seen in the <a href="autobuild.htm#stdanch1">
AutoBuild</a> web page under &quot;Specifying which columns of 
data to use from input data files&quot;.

<p><H5>Guessing cell contents</H5></p>
<p>  The AutoBuild Wizard uses the sequence information
in your sequence file (<b>sequence.dat</b>) and the cell parameters and space
group to guess the number of NCS copies and the solvent fraction:
</p><PRE style="face=courier"> 
Number of residues in unique chains in seq file: 181
Unit cell: (106.82, 62.34, 114.19, 90, 90, 90)
Space group: P 21 21 21 (No. 19)
CELL VOLUME :760409.359319
N_EQUIV:4
GUESS OF NCS COPIES: 4
SOLVENT FRACTION ESTIMATE: 0.48
Data file (for everything including refinement): a2u-sigmaa.mtz
</PRE>

<p><H5>Running phenix.xtriage</H5></p>
<p>  The AutoBuild Wizard automatically 
runs phenix.xtriage on  your input datafile to analyze it
for twinning, outliers, translational symmetry, and other special 
conditions that you should be aware of.  You can read more about
xtriage in <a href="xtriage.htm">Data quality assessment 
with phenix.xtriage</a>.  The xtriage output is in the file
<b>a2u-sigmaa.mtz_xtriage.log</b>. 
Part of the summary output from xtriage for this
dataset looks like this:
</p><PRE style="face=courier"> 
The largest off-origin peak in the Patterson function is 5.10% of the
height of the origin peak. No significant pseudotranslation is detected.

The results of the L-test indicate that the intensity statistics
behave as expected. No twinning is suspected.


</PRE>

<p><H5>Generation of FreeR flags</H5></p>
<p>The AutoBuild Wizard will create a set of free R flags indicating which 
reflections are not to be used in refinement. By default 5% of reflections
(up to a maximum of 2000)
are reserved for this test set. 
If you supply a reflection file with free R flags already set, then they
will be used.  If you want to supply a file <b>ref.mtz</b>specifically 
for refinement, you can do that with <b>input_refinement_file=ref.mtz</b>.
Also if you want to supply 
a high-resolution datafile <b>hires.mtz</b> that has 
then you can do this with the keywords <b>input_hires_file=hires.mtz</b>.

After generation of free R flags if necessary, and any merging of data files,
the file to be used for refinement is called <b>exptl_fobs_phases_freeR_flags.mtz</b>.

<p><H5>Rebuild-in-place model-building with RESOLVE</H5></p>
<p>The AutoBuild Wizard by default uses RESOLVE to build an atomic model
of your structure.   In this example the rebuild-in-place option is used.
</p>
<p>The first step is to simply refine the edited input model:
</p><PRE style="face=courier"> 
Using edited_pdb.pdb for rebuild, copied to unrefined.pdb_1
Refining model:  unrefined.pdb_1
Refined model: refine.pdb_1  R/Rfree=0.32/0.35
</PRE>
<p>This starting model is rather good, with an R of 0.32.  This is about the
quality of model that works best with rebuild-in-place. The NCS in this
model is analyzed automatically:
</p><PRE style="face=courier"> 
GROUP 1
Summary of NCS group with 4 operators:
ID of chain/residue where these apply: 
[['A', 'B', 'C', 'D'], [[[1, 157]], [[1, 157]], [[1, 157]], [[1, 157]]]]
RMSD (A) from chain A:  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0
Number of residues matching chain A:[157, 157, 157, 157]
Source of NCS info: AutoBuild_run_1_/TEMP0/overall_best.pdb
Correlation of NCS: 0.76
</PRE>
<p>There is good correlation of NCS-related density (as expected as all the
density is model-based so far) and the 4 chains have a 0.0 RMSD after
application of NCS (also expected as we have simply placed the same molecule
in 4 different orientations and locations in the asymmetric unit).
</p><p>
The rebuild-in place procedure is then carried out:
</p><PRE style="face=courier"> 
Rebuilding in place: refine.pdb_1
New total residues built:  559

Warning: some residues not rebuilt successfully on cycle 2:
Chain 'A':    1-  10,
Chain 'C':    1-  10,   61-  65,  151- 157,
Chain 'B':    1-  10,   61-  65,
Chain 'D':    1-  10,   61-  65,  151- 157
Refining model:  Build_rebuild_in_place_1.pdb
Refined model: AutoBuild_run_1_/TEMP0/refine_1.pdb  R/Rfree=0.23/0.27


</PRE>
<p>Notice the warning about some of the residues that were not rebuilt. For
any residues that the rebuilding process simply could not fit, the original
coordinates are kept. In favorable cases, by the end of iterative model-building
all the coordinates can be fit. In cases where they cannot, you should be
cautious about using those parts of the model that do not get rebuilt.
In this case the R has decreased substantially by rebuilding to 0.23.
</p><p>The side chains are then rebuilt, and the best-fitting parts of the
current models are recombined to yield a new model with a similar (slightly worse)
R of 0.24:
</p><PRE style="face=courier"> 
Rebuilding side chains from  Build_composite_refined_3.pdb
Refining model:  edit_model.pdb
Refined model: AutoBuild_run_1_/TEMP0/Build_composite_refined_side_3.pdb  R/Rfree=0.24/0.28
</PRE>
<p> This is the end of the first cycle of rebuilding. Next the rebuilt model
is used to calculate phases and the resulting map is used in statistical
density modification, including not just solvent flattening and histograms
of density, but also the 4-fold NCS in this structure.  This whole process is
repeated 7 times, yielding a final R/Rfree of 0.21/0.25.  On the final
cycle of model-building a few residues are still not rebuilt:
</p><PRE style="face=courier"> 
Warning: some residues not rebuilt successfully on cycle 8:
Chain 'C':    1-  10,  156- 157,
Chain 'B':    1-  10,
Chain 'D':    1-  10
</PRE>
<p>and these residues (the N-terminal 10 residues of chains B, C,
and D) and the C-terminal 2 residues of chain C) should probably not be used
in the model.
</p><p>

The final refined model is written out to <b>cycle_best.pdb_4</b> in
the output directory. An identical file has the name <b>overall_best.pdb</b>
which may be more convenient to remember.
</p><p>Note that the quality of the model improves a lot in the first cycle
and not very much after that. This is common in the rebuild-in-place procedure.

<p><H5>The AutoBuild_summary.dat summary file</H5></p>
A quick summary of the results of your AutoBuild run is in the
<b>AutoBuild_summary.dat</b> file in your output directory.  This file lists the
key files that were produced in your run of AutoBuild (all these are in the
output directory) and some of the key statistics for the run.
Here is the summary for this <b>a2u-globulin-rebuild</b> model-building run:

<p><H5>How do I know if iterative model-building, density modification 
and refinement with rebuild-in-place worked?</H5></p>
<p>Here are some of the things to look for to tell if you have obtained a 
good model:
<UL>
<LI>How much of the model failed to be rebuilt with the
rebuild-in-place procedure? This should be a very small part of the model at
most. If 25% of your model cannot be rebuilt, then the density is probably
very weak (or the resolution may be too low).
</LI>
<LI>What is the R-factor and the free R-factor of the model? 
For a solution at moderate to high
resolution (2.5 A or better) the R-factor should be in the low 20's and the
free R-factor about 0.05 higher to be very 
good. For lower-resolution data, an R-factor in the low 30's is probably
largely correct but the model is not very good.
</LI>
<LI>Does the model show NCS if there are more than one copies in the 
asymmetric unit? You can look at the file  <b>AutoBuild.ncs_spec_xx</b> (xx is 
the solution number) which will tell you about any NCS in your model.

<p><H5>What to do next</H5></p>
<p>Once you have run AutoBuild and have obtained a good model,
you will want to inspect and touch up the model carefully, rebuilding any
parts of the model that do not agree well with the final map. You should also
have a close look at all the solvent molecules in your model, making sure that
they all have reasonable relationships to the macromolecule and to each other, 
and
that they are not simply filling up density where a ligand or the macromolecule
really goes. <p>
<p>The next thing to do is to add in any ligands (metals, cofactors) if there is
density for them. You can use the LigandFit Wizard (see 
<A href="ligandfit.htm">Automated Ligand Fitting using LigandFit</A> ) to help
you fit ligands into your map automatically. 

</p><p>If you do not obtain a good model, then it's not quite time to give
up yet. There are a number of standard things to try that may improve the
model building. Here are a few that you should try:
<UL>
<LI>Have a careful look at all the output files. Work your way through
the main log file (e.g., <b>AutoBuild_run_1_1.log</b>). 
Is there anything 
strange or unusual in any of them that may give you a clue as to
what to try next?  What does the xtriage output say? Is there twinning or
strong translational symmetry? Are there problems with reflections near
ice rings? Are there many outlier reflections?
</LI>
<LI>Have a look at the electron density maps at different stages in
model building.  How does the starting map look?  How about the maps produced
during the iterative building process 
(<b>cycle_best_refine_map_coeffs.mtz_xx</b>)?
If the maps look poor, then the rebuilding process will not work well. 
However if
the maps look good and the rebuilding is not working well then it is 
worth trying to identify where the problem is.
</LI>

<LI>Try a different resolution cutoff.  You may be able to use higher-resolution
data in AutoBuild than you used in structure solution.
