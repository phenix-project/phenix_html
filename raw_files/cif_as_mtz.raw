<p>Unlike most other reflection formats, the CIF files used by the PDB to store
experimental data are not supported for direct input to PHENIX.
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">phenix.cif_as_mtz</span></tt> is a simple utility for importing these files, and can
automatically identify and fix several errors common in the PDB, such as
incorrectly labeled intensities in place of amplitudes.  Unfortunately, many
structures fail to parse properly, so this tool is not guaranteed to work in
all cases.</p>
<P><H5><U><B>Using the PHENIX GUI</B></U></H5><P>
<p>Open the main GUI and click &quot;Import CIF structure factors&quot; under the
&quot;Reflection tools&quot; category.  Only the CIF file is required, but a PDB file
will often be necessary to obtain the correct symmetry information.  Click
&quot;Use model to guess data type&quot; if you want PHENIX to do a sanity check on
the labeled amplitudes (which may not really be amplitudes!).</p>
<div class="image"><img alt="images/cif_as_mtz.png" src="images/cif_as_mtz.png" /></div>
<p>If you know the PDB ID but haven't downloaded the necessary files yet, you
can simply enter the ID into the box in the upper right corner and click &quot;Run&quot;,
and the PDB and CIF files will be fetched automatically from the RCSB web
server.</p>

Usage: phenix.cif_as_mtz [reflection_cif_file] [options]

                        Show data details for some errors.
  --show-log            Show some output.
  --merge               Merge non-unique data (preserves anomalous pairs)
  --eliminate_sys_absent
                        Remove systematic absences
  --map_to_asu          Map HKL indices to canonical asymmetric unit
  --incompatible_flags_to_work_set
                        When merging place reflections with incompatible
                        flags into the working set.

Example: phenix.cif_as_mtz r1o9ksf.ent --symmetry=pdb1o9k.ent
</pre>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--symmetry</span></tt> argument is frequently required due to missing symmetry
information; in these cases you should use the equivalent PDB file.  Most of
the other options are usually not necessary, but <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--use-model</span></tt> is often
helpful to get the data type right.</p>
<p>As a shortcut to download the files from the RCSB (or mirror) website, PHENIX
includes a tool for fetching data for a given PDB code:</p>
<blockquote>
phenix.fetch_pdb 2hr0
phenix.fetch_pdb -x 2hr0</blockquote>
<p>The argument &quot;-x&quot; specifies that the structure factors should be downloaded
instead of the PDB file.  (This will only work if the authors deposited their
data.)</p>
<P><H5><U><B>Output</B></U></H5><P>
<p>Assuming that the data were successfully extracted, the program will create an
MTZ file with columns FOBS, SIGFOBS (these will be treated as group by most
applications in PHENIX), and R-free-flags.  In many cases there will be fewer
reflections in the output than data lines in the CIF file; this is due to
the presence of non-numeric or otherwise unintelligible values.</p>
