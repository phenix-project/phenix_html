<H5>How should I cite PHENIX?</H5>
<p>
If you use PHENIX please cite:
</p><p>
Adams, P.D., Grosse-Kunstleve, R.W., Hung, L.-W., Ioerger, T.R., McCoy, A.J.,
Moriarty, N.W., Read, R.J., Sacchettini, J.C., Sauter, N.K., Terwilliger, T.C.

determination. Acta Cryst. D58, 1948-1954.

<H5>What do I do if the PHENIX GUI hangs?</H5>
<p>If the GUI hangs (windows do not respond or windows display partially) then
you may want to try and kill it by clicking on the upper right corner ,
or right-clicking on the top bar of the GUI and closing it. If those fail,
you can control-C in the window where you started up the GUI.
In either case, you can restart the GUI by typing <b>phenix</b> again. You
may find it necessary to start phenix up, then close it down nicely with
Project/Exit, and restart it (this gets rid of some files that are deleted
when the GUI closes normally).  You may also occasionally find it necessary
to kill any jobs that are still running by running <b>top</b> and
noticing if there are python or resolve or solve jobs running that were
part of your PHENIX job, then using <b>k</b> to kill those jobs while
running top.
</p>

<H5>Why does the GUI Parameters window say "Invalid input parameters...do you want to continue?"</H5>
<p>This happens if something in the window isn't correct. If no colored entry fields come up, have a look at the bottom where it says NAVIGATE  SET VARIABLE AUTO MANUAL.  The entry forms under these words should read:
"Choose method to run"  "Choose variable to set" and "Manual" (or "Automatic")
unless you have intentionally set them.
If that isn't it, look carefully at all the entries and make sure that they
are of the type that is expected (file name, number, etc).  If that doesn't
work, just click YES and carry on.
</p>

<H5>How do I stop a Wizard?</H5>
<p>You can stop a Wizard in two ways. For a "soft" stop, press the "Pause" button
if you are running from the GUI, or create a file with the name STOPWIZARD in
the directory where the Wizard is running (i.e., create
 AutoBuild_run_4_/STOPWIZARD to stop run 4 of the AutoBuild Wizard).
For a hard stop from the GUI, you can select "Strategy" on the top line of
the GUI and then select "Stop Strategy" at the bottom of the choices. That
kills the Wizard and all associated jobs.  You can still go on from there;
select the Parameters window (the lines at the upper left of the now-yellow
GUI window) and choose what to do next.
</p>


<H5>Where can I find sample data?</H5>
<p>You can find sample data in the directories located in:
<b>$PHENIX/examples</b>. Additionally there is sample MR data
 in <b>$PHENIX/phaser/tutorial</b>.
</p>
<H5>Can I easily run a Wizard with some sample data?</H5>
<p>You can run sample data with a Wizard with a simple command. To run
<b>p9-sad</b> sample data with the AutoSol wizard, you type:
</p><PRE style="face=courier">phenix.run_example  p9-sad </PRE>
<p>This command copies the <b>$PHENIX/examples/p9-sad</b> directory to 
your working directory and executes the commands in the file 
<b>run.csh</b>.</p>

<H5>What sample data are available to run automatically?</H5>
<p>You can see which sample data are set up to run automatically
by typing: 
</p><PRE style="face=courier">phenix.run_example  --help </PRE>
<p>This command lists all the directories in <b>$PHENIX/examples/</b> that
have a command file <b>run.csh</b> ready to use. For example:
</p><PRE style="face=courier">phenix.run_example  --help 

PHENIX run_example script. Fri Jul  6 12:07:08 MDT 2007

Use: phenix.run_example example_name [--all] [--overwrite]
Data will be copied from PHENIX examples into subdirectories
of this working directory
If --all is set then all examples will be run (takes a long time!)
If --overwrite is set then the script will overwrite subdirectories

List of available examples:  1J4R-ligand a2u-globulin-mr gene-5-mad 
p9-build p9-sad 

</PRE>

<H5>Are any of the sample datasets annotated?</H5>
<p>The PHENIX tutorials listed on the main
<a href="phenix_documentation.html">PHENIX </a>
web page will walk you through sample datasets, telling
you what to look for in the output files. For example, the
<A href="tutorial_sad.htm">Tutorial 1: Solving a structure using SAD data</A>
tutorial uses the <b>p9-sad</b> dataset as example. It tells you how to
run this example data in AutoSol and how to interpret the results.
