<P><H5><U>Purpose</U></H5><P>

ERRASER (Enumerative Real-space Refinment ASsisted by Electron-density under
Rosetta) is an application for improving RNA crystal structures based on 
Rosetta and Phenix. 

<P><H5><U>Usage</U></H5><P>

<P><H5>How erraser works:</H5><P>

By supplementing the Rosetta RNA scoring function with electron-density 
restraint, ERRASER can confidently reduce the errors in RNA crystallographic 
models while retaining a good fit to the diffraction data. Two ERRASER 
applications are currently available. The standard ERRASER application 
remodels all the potentially problematic nucleotides in a RNA model in an 
automatic fashion, and output one final model. The ERRASER single residue 
rebuilding application apply ERRASER algorithm to a residue specified by user, 
and return up to 10 top-score models plus the minimized starting model. The 
first application is useful for automatic improving the entire model globally, 
and the second application is useful when the user wants to explore all 
possible alternative conformations for a problematic nucleotide and examine 
each one manually.

<P><H5>Installation notes</H5><P>

To run ERRASER you need to have Rosetta version 3.5 or later installed
on your machine. Rosetta can be downloaded at 
<A href="https://www.rosettacommons.org/software/>. For Rosetta installation 
notes and setting the environmental variable PHENIX_ROSETTA_PATH to tell 
Phenix where to find Rosetta, refer to the 
<A href="mr_rosetta.htm">phenix.mr_rosetta</A> documentation.

<P><H5><I>Input files preparation</I></H5><P>

<B>input_model.pdb</B>: A PDB file with your starting RNA model. Please ensure 
it is in the standard PDB format otherwise ERRASER might not run properly.

<P>

<B>mapfile.ccp4</B>: A 2mFo-DFc density map for your model in CCP4 format that 
covers the entire unit cell. Rfree reflections should be removed in map creation 
to avoid overfitting. We also suggest one to fill the missing data with 
calculated data to avoid Fourier truncation error. The following options are 
suggested if PHENIX map calculation utility (GUI) is used in map creation:
"Kicked", "Fill missing f obs", and "Exclude free r reflections" set to True.
Also in "Map region", select "Unit Cell".

<P><H5><U>Examples</U></H5><P>

  Running ERRASER is easy. From the command-line you can
type:
<PRE style="face=courier">phenix.erraser model.pdb mapfile.ccp4
</PRE>
This command will have erraser rebuild your entire model.
Here are some commonly used options to include:
"map_reso=2.2" gives tha map resolution (2.2 angstrom here), which highly
recommended to include as this usually gives better performance.
"n_iterate=2" allows ERRASER to iterate twice before output the model. This 
takes much longer time but might gives better improvement.
"fixed_res= A20 B15" gives residues to be fixed during remodeling. The format
is chain ID followed by residue numbers. ERRASER currently did not model 
ligands (anything starts with "HETATM" in PDB, including modifies bases), 
proteins, and crystal contacts in a structure. Therefore we suggest to fix the 
position of nucleotides that are in close contact with protein or ligand 
component.

<P>

  You can also run ERRASER in single residue rebuilding mode:
<PRE style="face=courier">phenix.erraser model.pdb mapfile.ccp4 single_res_mode=True rebuild_res_pdb=A30
</PRE>
This will rebuild just residue 30 in chain A and output up to 10 models for 
manual inspection.

<P><H5><I>Output files from erraser</I></H5><P>

For standard ERRASER:
<P>
<B>model_erraser.pdb</B>: A PDB file with your rebuilt RNA model.

<P>

For single residue rebuilding mode:
<P>
<B>model_0.pdb, model_1.pdb...</B>: Up to 10 different models with the
specified residue rebuilt.

<P>

In both modes, after the models are generated, the application will analyze 
the models and output a detailed comparison of the changes introduced by 
ERRASER.

<P><H5><U>Possible Problems</U></H5><P>

<P><H5>Specific limitations and problems:</H5><P>

ERRASER works only for RNA currently. Other parts in crystallographic model, 
including proteins, modified bases and ligands, are not being modeled. 
Remodeling of RNA residues that are in close contact with these components 
may be problematic.

<P>

Currently crystal contacts are not being modeled, which is known to cause 
problems in a few test cases when RNA is interacting strongly with its 
crystal-packing partner (ex. base-pairing and base-stacking). Right now this 
problem can be resolved by mannually adding the crystal-packing partner into 
the starting pdb file or forcing these residues as "fixed_res" during the run.
