<p>There are many formats for specifying a polysaccharides as seen in this diagram
from Herget et al. 2008.</p>
<div class="image"><img alt="images/glyco_formats.png" src="images/glyco_formats.png" width="600" /></div>
<p>The article introduces a format known as GlycoCT.</p>
<p>A common and compact molecule specification format is known as SMILES
(ref) which stands for. It relies on the specification of the elements
and the bonds (both implicit and explicit) of a molecule. Branches and
rings can also be specified.</p>

<p>Because protein crystallographers are conversant with the concept of
residues and polysaccharides are polymers of various carbohydrate
units, the step to equating an element to a sugar residue and a
chemical bond to a glycosidic link is easy. Polysaccharides are
simpler because there are no polymeric rings (only rings within the
residue unit).  However, the linking is more complicated. Firstly,
there are more types of links compared to the basic three in molecules
(single, double, triple).  Secondly, the type of the link relies on
the attaching carbohydrate (α, β).</p>

<p>Conceptually, it is easiest to think of one sugar unit linking to the
rest of the polysaccharide. For instance, this is the portion that
attached to the protein. So, the most common polysaccharide attached
to a protein is an N-linked chain that has three units in a linear
chain linked to an ASN. The three-letter code for each of the units in
order is NAG, NAG, MAN <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id6" id="id3" name="id3">[1]</a>. It is not a leap to imagine that
this could be represented using:</p>
<blockquote>
<a class="reference" href="images/scales_carbo1.png">NAG-NAG-MAN</a> <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id7" id="id4" name="id4">[2]</a></blockquote>
<p>As with SMILES, there is a default link. In SMILES, it's a single
bound while in SCaLES the default is β(1-4). This linkage means
that the attaching unit is connecting its anomeric carbon (C1) to the
forth carbon (C4) on the other unit.  It also specifies that the
attaching unit is a β-isomer. In the example, MAN is a mannose
saccharide but it is the α-isomer so it should:</p>
<blockquote>
<a class="reference" href="images/scales_carbo2.png">NAG-NAG-BMA</a></blockquote>
<p>However, the SCaLES parser automatically detects that the final residue is the
incorrect isomer and changes the code from MAN to BMA: The linkage takes
precedence. The specify an alternative to the default linkage, it can be
indicated thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<a class="reference" href="images/scales_carbo3.png">NAG-NAG-a-(1-4)-MAN</a></blockquote>
<p>The hand of the linkage can be specified with &quot;a&quot; or &quot;alpha&quot; and the carbon
atoms being linked can be specified using &quot;(1-4)&quot; or &quot;(1,4)&quot;.</p>
<P><H5><U><B></B></U></H5><P>
<p>Branching is specified using square brackets (compared to parenthesises in
SMILES) thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<a class="reference" href="images/scales_carbo4.png">NAG-[a-(1-6)-FUC]-NAG-BMA</a></blockquote>
<p>The branching can contain more than one saccharide:</p>
<blockquote>
<a class="reference" href="images/scales_carbo5.png">NAG-NAG-BMA-[a-(1-3)-MAN-a-(1-2)-MAN-a-(1-2)-MAN]-a-(1-6)-MAN-[a-(1-3)-MAN-a-(1-2)-MAN]-a-(1-6)-MAN-a-(1-2)-MAN</a></blockquote>
