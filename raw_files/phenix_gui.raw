<H5><U>Purpose</U></H5>

To provide a simple and easy graphical interface to the features of the
PHENIX package.  In particular, the concept of a wizard that guides the
user through the complex process of solving a protein structure, is a
powerful tool.

Wizards can be loaded by double clicking on the Wizard menu to the left of
the GUI.  The wizard loads and provides an interface to request information
from the user.  Details on wizards can be found in:

<H5><U>Strategies</U></H5>

<P>The main window of the PHENIX GUI is the strategy canvas.
The strategy canvas allows the user to construct a strategy from the
tasks in the menu in the left window.  Choosing a task from the menu
will attach that task to the mouse.  The mouse will change to a hand icon
while in the canvas window and there is a task attached.  Clicking
inside the canvas will place the task on the closest grid point.  Help
on tasks can be obtained by right-clicking on the task menu item to
reveal a pop-up menu.

<P>A similar situation exists for the strategy menu.  Choosing a strategy
will load it into a new strategy canvas.  These strategies are loaded
with the default task inputs providing a "clean slate" strategy for
user customization.  Right-clicking will reveal a pop-up menu for
strategy loading option including overwriting the current strategy or
adding to the current strategy.

<P>Tasks can be moved in one of two ways.  The first involves using the
left mouse button to click-drag-drop the task.  This must be done in
the title panel of the task.  The second option is useful in
situations where there is a delay between the mouse action and the GUI
update.  This happens when using a remote machine to run the GUI.
Moving a task can be achieve by right mouse clicking on the title
panel and then right clicking where the task should be re-located.
The mouse cursor will change to indicate the attachment of the task.

<P>Each task has up to five buttons along the top of the title panel.  The
right most button deletes the task from the canvas.  The left most button
is a toggle to indicate which task to commence the calculation.  The
remaining three buttons are present if the appropriate function is available
for that task.

<P>The upper-most task in the above figure displays all five buttons.
The second button is the task parameter button. A dialog is displayed
that allows the user to edit the input and output of that task.  The
number and type of information is dependent on the task.

<P>The third button is the display button.  This launches the appropriate
windows for display the results of a task.  For example, the 'import
pdb' task will display the PDB header information in a text control or
the molecule in a molecular graphical interface program PyMOL.

<P>The fourth button is the help button.  Help for the task is displayed
via this option.

<P>Two tasks can be linked by moving the lower panels of one task over
the title panel of another.  There can be any number of connection panels
associated with a task.  Logical operations can be provided to choose the 
appropriate linkage to follow.

<P>The connection between tasks is not data flow but time flow.  Each
task obtains its data from the PHENIX Data Storage Server and sends
its output data to the PDS server.  Subsequent tasks can get data
sent to the PDS server by previous tasks.

<P>The colors of the task indicate the activity of the strategy.  A
purple task means that it has finished running.  The green task is the
currently running task and blue indicates a task that hasn't been run.
Red indicates a task that failed during calculation and yellow is used
when a strategy run is stopped by the user.

<P>The task menu on the left side of the strategy canvas is divided into
sub-menus. The ``development`` sub-menu contains experimental tasks.
The ``examples`` sub-menu has some demonstrative tasks.  The remaining
sub-menus are self explanatory.

<P>The overview window in the bottom left corner allows navigation of the
canvas when large strategies are used.
