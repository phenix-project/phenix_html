A list of good keywords is in good_list.  You might
want to find all the keywords that are new that are not in this list and
add all the bad ones to reject.  You can do this with:

---------------------------
phenix.python new.py > skip.dat

which will write out all the NEW words in the index to skip.dat, and ALL the
words in the index to "all_list".  

If you are all done, copy all_list to good_list.  Otherwise...

Delete all the GOOD ones from skip.dat and  then  sort them with:


cat reject skip.dat > all_bad.unsorted
phenix.python  sort_lines.py all_bad.unsorted > reject


Then run 
phenix.python new.py > skip.dat
again and copy all_list to good_list.

------------------------

To get a list of all the keywords in the index:

cat ../phenix_index.htm | grep '<LI>' | grep -v '<LI><A' > list1.dat
...and edit list1.dat , removing all ok words and the <LI> for all, and then
put it in skip.dat
 
cat reject skip.dat > all_bad.unsorted
phenix.python  sort_lines.py all_bad.unsorted > reject
