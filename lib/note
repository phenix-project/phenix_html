A list of good keywords is in good_list.  You might
want to find all the keywords that are new that are not in this list and
add all the bad ones to reject.

To get a list of all the keywords in the index:

cat ../phenix_index.htm | grep '<LI>' | grep -v '<LI><A' > list1.dat
...and edit list1.dat , removing all ok words and the <LI> for all, and then
put it in skip.dat
 
cat reject skip.dat > all_bad.unsorted
phenix.python  sort_lines.py all_bad.unsorted > reject
