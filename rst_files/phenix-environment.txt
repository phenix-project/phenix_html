The PHENIX environment
======================

Setting up your environment
---------------------------

Once you have successfully installed PHENIX, to set up your environment
please source the phenix\_env file in the phenix installation directory
(for example):

::

    % source /usr/local/phenix-<version>/phenix_env [sh/tcsh users]

or

::

    % . /usr/local/phenix-<version>/phenix_env.sh [sh/bash users]

To run jobs remotely, you need to source the phenix\_env in your .cshrc
(or equivalent) file.

The following environmental variables should now be defined (here with
example values):

-  PHENIX=/usr/local/phenix
-  PHENIX\_INSTALLER\_DATE=080920070957
-  PHENIX\_VERSION=1.3
-  PHENIX\_RELEASE\_TAG=final
-  PHENIX\_ENVIRONMENT=1
-  PHENIX\_MTYPE=intel-linux-2.6-x86\_64
-  PHENIX\_MVERSION=linux
-  PHENIX\_USE\_MTYPE=intel-linux-2.6-x86\_64

It is not necessary (or useful) to define environmental variables for
SOLVE/RESOLVE for PHENIX. If you have them set in your environment they
are ignored by PHENIX.

Documentation
-------------

You can find documentation in the PHENIX GUI (under the Help menu).
Alternatively, you can use a web browser to view the documentation
supplied with PHENIX, by typing:

::

    % phenix.doc

If this doesn't work because of browser installation issues then you can
point a web browser to the correct location in your PHENIX installation
(for example):

::

    % firefox /usr/local/phenix-<version>/doc/index.html

or:

::

    % mozilla $PHENIX/doc/index.html

For license information please see the LICENSE file.
