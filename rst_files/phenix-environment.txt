The PHENIX environment
======================

If you intend to use the graphical interface and installed Phenix using the
Mac or Windows graphical installers, no further configuration is necessary -
just double-click the icon for the main Phenix GUI.  Instructions below are
for users of the command-line installer and/or programs.

Setting up your environment
---------------------------

Once you have successfully installed PHENIX, to set up your environment
please source the phenix\_env file in the phenix installation directory
(for example - replace "<version>" with the actual installed version,
such as "1.8.4-1496"):

::

    % source /usr/local/phenix-<version>/phenix_env [sh/tcsh users]

or

::

    % . /usr/local/phenix-<version>/phenix_env.sh [sh/bash users]

To run jobs remotely, you need to source the phenix\_env in your .cshrc
(or equivalent) file.

If you used the graphical Mac installer, you can find the files here:

::

  /Applications/PHENIX-<version>/Contents/phenix-<version>/phenix_env*

The following environmental variables should now be defined (here with
example values)::

   PHENIX=/usr/local/phenix
   PHENIX\_INSTALLER\_DATE=080920070957
   PHENIX\_VERSION=1.3
   PHENIX\_RELEASE\_TAG=final
   PHENIX\_ENVIRONMENT=1
   PHENIX\_MTYPE=intel-linux-2.6-x86\_64
   PHENIX\_MVERSION=linux
   PHENIX\_USE\_MTYPE=intel-linux-2.6-x86\_64

It is not necessary (or useful) to define environmental variables for
SOLVE/RESOLVE for PHENIX. If you have them set in your environment they
are ignored by PHENIX.

Documentation
-------------

You can find documentation in the PHENIX GUI (under the Help menu).
Alternatively, you can use a web browser to view the documentation
supplied with PHENIX, by typing:

::

    % phenix.doc

If this doesn't work because of browser installation issues then you can
point a web browser to the correct location in your PHENIX installation
(for example):

::

    % firefox /usr/local/phenix-<version>/doc/index.html

or:

::

    % mozilla $PHENIX/doc/index.html
