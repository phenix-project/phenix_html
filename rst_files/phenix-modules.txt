Data Analysis
-------------

Detection of twinning and other pathologies is facilitated via the
program `phenix.xtriage <reference/xtriage.html>`__. This command line driven
program analyses an experimental data set and provides diagnostics that
aid in the detection of common idiosyncrasies such as the presence of
pseudo translational symmetry, certain data processing problems and
twinning. Other sanity checks, such as a Wilson plot sanity check and an
algorithm that tries to detect the presence of ice rings from the merged
data are performed as well. If twin laws are present for the given unit
cell and space group, a Britton plot is computed, an H-test is performed
and a likelihood based method is used to provide an estimate of the twin
fraction. Twin laws are deduced from first principles for each data set,
avoiding the danger of over-looking twin laws by incomplete lookup
tables. If a model is available, more efficient twin detection tools are
available. The RvsR statistic is particularly useful in the detection of
twinning in combination with pseudo rotational symmetry. This statistic
is computed by phenix.xtriage if calculated data is supplied together
with the observed data. A more direct test for the presence of twinning
is by refinement of the twin fraction given an atomic model (which can
be performed in phenix.refine). The command line utility
phenix.twin\_map\_utils provides a quick way to refine a twin fraction
given an atomic model and an X-ray data set and also produces

Automated Structure Solution Using Experimental Phasing Techniques
------------------------------------------------------------------

Structure solution via SAD, MAD or SIR(AS) can be carried out with the
`AutoSol <reference/autosol.html>`__ wizard.  `AutoSol
<reference/autosol.html>`__
performs heavy atom location, phasing, density modification and initial
model building in an automated manner. The heavy atoms are located with
substructure solution engine also used in phenix.hyss, a dual space
method similar to SHELXD and Shake and Bake. Phasing is carried out with
PHASER for SAD cases and with SOLVE for MAD and SIR(AS) cases.
Subsequent density modification is carried out with RESOLVE. The hand of
the substructure is determined automatically on the basis of the quality
of the resulting electron density map. It is noteworthy that the whole
process is not necessarily linear but that the wizard can decide to step
back and (for instance) try another set of heavy atoms if appropriate.
In the resulting electron density map, a model is built (currently
limited to proteins). Further model completion can be carried out via
the `AutoBuild <reference/autobuild.html>`__ wizard.
`AutoBuild <reference/autobuild.html>`__ iterates model building and density
modification with refinement of the model in a scheme similar to other
iterative model building methods, for example ARP/wARP.

Automated Structure Solution Via Molecular Replacement
------------------------------------------------------

Structure solution via molecular replacement is facilitated via the
`MRage <reference/MRage.html>`_ procedure.
`MRage <reference/MRage.html>`_
guides the user through setting up all necessary parameters to run a
molecular replacement job with PHASER. The molecular replacement carried
out by PHASER uses likelihood based scoring function, improving the
sensitivity of the procedure and the ability to obtain reasonable
solutions with search models that have a relatively low sequence
similarity to the crystal structure being determined. Besides the use of
likelihood based scoring functions, structure solution is enhanced by
detailed bookkeeping of all search possibilities when searching for more
then a single copy in the asymmetric unit or when there the choice of
space group is ambiguous. When a suitable molecular replacement solution
is found, the `AutoBuild <reference/autobuild.html>`__ wizard is invoked and
rebuilds the molecular replacement model given the sequence of the model
under investigation.

Automated Model Building
------------------------

Automated model building given a starting model or a set of reasonable
phases can be carried out by the `AutoBuild <reference/autobuild.html>`__ wizard. A
typical AutoBuild job combines density modification, model building,
macromolecular refinement and solvent model updates ('water picking') in
an iterative manner. Various modes of building a model are available.
Depending on the availability of a molecular model, model building can
be carried by locally rebuilding an existing model (rebuild in place) or
by building in the density without any information of an available
model. The rebuilding in place model building is a powerful building
scheme that is used by default for molecular replacement models that
have a high sequence similarity to the sequence of the structure that is
to be built. A fundamental feature of the `AutoBuild <reference/autobuild.html>`__
wizard is that it builds various models, all from slightly different
starting points. The dependency of the outcome of the model building
algorithm on initial starting conditions provides a straightforward
mechanism to obtain a variety of plausible molecular models. It is not
uncommon that certain sections of a map are built in one model, while
not in another. Combining these models allows the
`AutoBuild <reference/autobuild.html>`__ wizard to converge faster to a more
complete model than when using a single model building pass for a given
set of phases. Dedicated loop fitting algorithms are used to close gaps
between chain segments. This feature, together with the water picking
and side chain placement, typically results in highly complete models of
high quality that need minimal manual intervention before they are ready
for deposition.

Structure Refinement
--------------------

The refinement engine used in the `AutoBuild <reference/autobuild.html>`__ and
`AutoSol <reference/autosol.html>`__ wizards can also be run from the command line
with the `phenix.refine <reference/refinement.html>`__ command. The phenix.refine
program carries out likelihood based refinement and has the possibility
to refine positional parameters, individual or grouped atomic
displacement parameters, individual or grouped occupancies. The
refinement of anisotropic displacement parameters (individual or via a
TLS parameterization) is also available. Positional parameters can be
optimized using either traditional gradient-only based optimization
methods, or via simulated annealing protocols. The command line
interface allows the user to specify which part of the model should be
refined in what manner. It is in principle possible to refine half of
the molecule as a rigid group with grouped B values, whereas the other
half of the molecule has a TLS parameterization. The flexibility of
specifying the level of parameterization of the model is especially
important for the refinement of low resolution data or when starting
with severely incomplete atomic models. Another advantage of this
flexibility in refinement strategy is that a user can perform a complex
refinement protocol that carries out simulated annealing, isotropic B
refinement and water picking in 'one go'. Another main feature of
`phenix.refine <reference/refinement.html>`__ is the way in which the relative
weights for the geometric and ADP restraints with respect to the X-ray
target are determined. Considerable effort has been put into devising a
good set of defaults and weight determination schemes that results in a
good choice of parameters for the data set under investigation. Defaults
can of course be overwritten if the user chooses to. Besides being able
to handle refinement against X-ray data,
`phenix.refine <reference/refinement.html>`__ can refine against neutron data or
against X-ray and neutron data simultaneously.

Automated ligand density analysis
---------------------------------

Automated fitting of ligands into the electron density is facilitated
via the `LigandFit <reference/ligandfit.html>`__ wizard. The ligand building is
performed by finding an initial fit for the largest rigid domain of the
ligand and extending the remaining part of the ligand from this initial
'seed'. Besides being able to fit a known ligand into a difference map,
the `LigandFit <reference/ligandfit.html>`__ wizard is capable of identifying
ligands on the basis of the difference density only. In the latter
scheme, density characteristics for ligands occurring frequently in the
PDB are used to provide the user with a range of plausible ligands.

Calculating ligand geometries and defining chemical restraints
--------------------------------------------------------------

Stereo chemical dictionaries of ligands whose chemical description is
not available in the supplied monomer library for the use in restrained
macromolecular refinement can be generated with the electronic ligand
builder and optimization workbench (eLBOW). eLBOW generates a 3D
geometry from a number of chemical input formats including MOL2 or PDB
files and SMILES strings. SMILES is a compact, chemically dense
description of a molecule that contains all element and bonding
information and optionally other stereo information such as chirality.
To generate a 3D geometry from an input format that contains no 3D
geometry information, `eLBOW <reference/elbow.html>`__ uses a Z-Matrix formalism in
conjunction with a table of bond lengths calculated using the
Hartree-Fock method with a 6-31G(d,p) basis set to obtain a Cartesian
coordinate set. The geometry is then optionally optimized using the
semi-empirical quantum chemistry method AM1. The AM1 optimization
provides chemically meaningful and accurate geometries for the class of
molecule typically complexed with proteins. `eLBOW <reference/elbow.html>`__
outputs the optimized geometry and a standard CIF restraint file that
can be read in by `phenix.refine <reference/refinement.html>`__ and can also be
used for real space refinement during manual model building sessions in
the program COOT. An interface is also available to use
`eLBOW <reference/elbow.html>`__ within COOT.
