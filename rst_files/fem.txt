phenix.development.fem: compute Feature Enhanced Map (FEM)
----------------------------------------------------------

**Description**

  This is a developmental version and it will be such until official publication
  in peer reviewed journal.

  The program reads PDB model, reflection data (Fobs or Iobs) and R-free
  flags, if available. Then it computes {2mFobs-DFmodel, Phase_model} map, which
  is subject to FEM procedure.

  Output is MTZ file with four sets of Fourier map coefficients:
    - 2mFoDFc,PHI2mFoDFc: usual {2mFobs-DFmodel, Phase_model} sigma-a weighted
      synthesis. No anisotropy correction or filling missing data.
    - 2mFoDFc_FilSharp,PHI2mFoDFc_FilSharp: same as above but B-factor sharpened,
      anisotropy corrected and missing Fobs are modeled.
    - KICK,PHIKICK: "kick" map
    - FEM,PHIFEM: Feature Enhanced Map

  Of real interest are only 2mFoDFc,PHI2mFoDFc (which is output to compare with
  FEM map) and FEM,PHIFEM - the main result of running this tool. The other map
  coefficients are present for information or debugging.

  Important:
    FEM map is not expected to contain any more signal than the original
    starting map. The new map is expected to contain less noise and all the
    available signal equalized in strength, so both strong and very weak signal
    are available for interpretation at the same threshold contouring level.

**Command line usage examples**::

  % phenix.fem model.pdb data.mtz
  % phenix.fem data.mtz model.pdb label=Fobs
  % phenix.fem model.pdb data.mtz scattering_label=neutron

**GUI**

  Graphical user interface is available

**Limitations**

  Currently only {2mFobs-DFmodel, Phase_model} map can be used in FEM protocol
  and it has to be computed internally by the program (that is no user-specified
  map coefficients can be used).
