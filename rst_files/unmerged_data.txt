Analyzing unmerged data in Phenix
=================================

Introduction
------------

Most of the programs in Phenix assume that the input data, regardless of
type or format, are already both scaled and merged to contain only unique
reflections.  The major exception is AutoSol, which can accept certain unmerged
files (for a more limited set of formats, primarily Scalepack) and performs its
own local scaling.  In other situations, some programs will automatically merge
the data themselves if necessary, discarding any information about the variance
of individual observations.

**A note on terminology: "unmerged" in this context means that the original
individual observations are kept separate after scaling**, including
symmetry-related
reflections as well as multiple observations of the same ``h,k,l``.  **This is
distinct from "anomalous" data**, where the Friedel mates ``h,k,l`` and
``-h,-k,-l`` are not merged, but each of these is (usually) still the average
of multiple observations.  Although many programs in Phenix deal with
anomalous data, they are not useful for calculating merging statistics.

Several utilities are available in Phenix which use unmerged intensities to
calculate various data quality-related metrics.  These include `Xtriage
<xtriage_gui.htm>`_, which will display standard merging statistics; the
standalone version of this routine, **phenix.merging_statistics**; a separate
utility for calculating CC* (Karplus & Diederichs 2012), **phenix.cc_star**;
and the `Table 1 <table_one.htm>`_ program.  Their use as it relates
to unmerged data is described below.  Note that due to implementation details,
small numerical differences (up to a  few tenths of a percent) may occur
between the originally reported statistics in the processing logfiles, and the
numbers reported by Phenix.

**Important**: we have provided a list of statistics with pointers to the
relevant publications in the "Details" section, but this document does not
attempt to explain the mathematics or
logic behind the statistics calculated here.  We strongly recommend that you
read the listed references; the publication(s) associated with the data
processing software used may also be useful (see for example Evans (2011)).

If you want to experiment with these programs and do not have any data of your
own to use, the Phenix installation includes an unmerged data file in the
p9-sad example:

  $PHENIX/examples/p9-sad/p9_se_w2.sca

The format does not contain complete symmetry information (and the space
group is specified incorrectly), but you can use the symmetry information in
``p9.pdb`` in the same directory.

Obtaining unmerged data
-----------------------

The procedure differs between various data-processing software; these are the
methods we are familiar with:

  - **xia2**: the DataFiles directory will contain a file in Scalepack format,
    ending in "_unmerged.sca".  No additional steps are required.

  - **aimless (CCP4)**: the OUTPUT keyword has an UNMERGED option.

  - **XDS**: the file named XDS_ASCII.HKL output by CORRECT will contain
    unmerged data.  If you are using XSCALE to scale data from multiple
    crystals, add the keyword MERGE=FALSE to the input script.

  - **HKL2000**: in the Macros tab, in the Scaling section type "no merge
    original index", then re-run scaling (with a different file name than you
    used for merged data).  This is currently incompatible with the
    "automatic correction" option, which will always output a merged file.

Note that unmerged Scalepack format does not include the unit cell, so symmetry
needs to be supplied from a different source (this is handled automatically in
many of the programs below).  MTZ and XDS formats include complete symmetry.

Xtriage and phenix.merging_statistics
-------------------------------------

.. image:: images/merging_statistics_gui.png

``phenix.merging_statistics`` is a simple program to calculate the standard
statistics output by most data processing software, such as mean(I/sigma),
redundancy, R-merge, R-meas (Diederichs & Karplus 1997), R-pim (Weiss 2001),
CC1/2, and others.  The input may be in any
format, including unmerged XDS, unmerged Scalepack, multi-batch MTZ, or SHELX
(the latter will only work on the command line, however).  The number of
resolution bins is set to 10 by default, but is adjustable by the n_bins
parameter.  All data will be used unless the high_resolution or low_resolution
parameters are set; the program does not attempt to identify an appropriate
high-resolution cutoff on its own.  Both a command-line tool and a GUI
(pictured above) are available.  The output in either case is a table of
statistics by resolution bin::


  Resolution: 28.53 - 1.75
  Observations: 145453
  Unique reflections: 21557
  Redundancy: 6.7
  Completeness: 99.92%
  Mean intensity: 18672.0
  Mean I/sigma(I): 14.9
  R-merge: 0.073
  R-meas:  0.079
  R-pim:   0.030

  Redundancies (non-anomalous):
    1 : 50

In the GUI version, plots are also available:

.. image:: images/merging_gui_r_factors.png

Xtriage (Zwart et al. 2005) will also calculate these statistics if provided
with unmerged intensities; in the GUI, these will appear in an extra tab before
the data quality analyses.

phenix.cc_star
--------------

This is an implementation of the method outlined in Karplus & Diederichs (2012)
for determining the optimal resolution cutoff, as an alternative to the
traditional criteria such as limits on R-merge or I/sigma.  It is essentially
a combination of phenix.merging_statistics with the recalculation of R-factors
for the model.  The statistics CC* is an estimate of the "true" CC of the data
under examination to the (unknown) true intensities.  This places it on the
same scale as CC(work) and CC(free) for the model and data, and the
relationship between these statistics can be used as a guide for truncating
the data.

.. image:: images/cc_star_gui.png

Required inputs are unmerged intensities, merged data (either amplitudes or
intensities - if the latter, French&Wilson treatment will be performed),
R-free flags, and either a pre-calculated F(model) array, which is output by
programs like phenix.refine, or the current refined model.  The results should
be essentially the same in either case, but supplying F(model) directly will
run faster.  The statistics overlap with those reported by the merging
program, but with the addition of R-factors and CCs for model/data agreement.

.. image:: images/cc_star_gui_table.png

phenix.table_one
----------------

`This utility <table_one.htm>`_ generates the standard Table 1 of
crystallographic statistics found in most structure publications.  If unmerged
data are included along with the merged data and R-free flags, the intensity
merging statistics will be calculated from these instead of parsing the
data processing logfiles.  We recommend that you use the unmerged data if
available, as they are more reliably parsed than logfiles.

Details for individual statistics
---------------------------------

Note that the programs listed above display slightly different subsets of
these statistics.

**Mean(I/sigmaI)**: the signal-to-noise ratio.  Traditionally the data are
often cut off at the resolution where this statistic declines to 2, but this
may exclude genuine measurements.

**Redundancy** or **Multiplicity**: the average number of observations of
each reflection.

**R-merge** or **R-symm**: the simple merging R-factor for the multiple
observations.  Ideally this should be as low as possible, but for reasons
discussed in the listed references, using it as a resolution cutoff is
problematic.  (Note that it will always increase significantly in the
high-resolution shells.)

**R-meas** or **R-rim**: an alternative to R-merge which is intended to be
independent of redundancy.  See Diederichs & Karplus (1997) for explanation.

**R-pim**: another alternative to R-merge, intended to show the precision of
the measurements.  See Weiss (2001).

**CC1/2**: the correlation of one half of the observations (chosen at random,
but with approximately even distribution for each reflection) to the other
half.  A similar statistic is used in electron microscopy; see Karplus &
Diederichs (2012) for more information.

**CC***: a modification of CC1/2, intended to show the true correlation of
the observed data to the unknown "true" intensities.  Used in conjunction with
CC(work) and CC(free).  See Karplus & Diederichs (2012).

**CC(work)** and **CC(free)**: correlation of the observed intensities to the
model-based intensities, for the work and test sets respectively.  Should be
on the same scale as CC*.
