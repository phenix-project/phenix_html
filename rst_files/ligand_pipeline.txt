Automated protein-ligand structure determination with phenix.ligand_pipeline
============================================================================

Overview
--------

``phenix.ligand_pipeline`` is an automation system combining `Xtriage
<xtriage.htm>`_, `Phaser <mr_overview.htm>`_, `eLBOW <elbow.htm>`_,
`phenix.refine <refinement.htm>`_, `AutoBuild <autobuild.htm>`_, and
`LigandFit <ligandfit.htm>`_, with optional interaction with `Coot
<coot.htm>`_.  In favorable cases, it can produce a near-finished structure
of a protein-ligand complex starting from minimal inputs, and can significantly
reduce the manual effort required for more difficult structures.

Program workflow

Interactive mode
----------------

For users desiring more control over the rebuilding process, or for difficult
cases where more aggressive model modifications are required, the program can
be run semi-interactively by adding the flag ``interactive=True`` (or
alternately, ``--interactive``).  This will launch Coot after the first
round of refinement, with model and maps loaded, allowing rebuilding to take
place.  The recommended procedure is to locate the putative ligand density
in the mFo-DFc map, and adjust the protein structure as necessary to remove
overlap with the ligand binding site (as well as any other modifications
that will not be automatically fixed by refinement and/or AutoBuild).  Once
rebuilding is complete, click the button "Return to PHENIX" to save the
edited model and resume the pipeline (the next step will be LigandFit, with
new maps).

Because the interactive mode overcomes many of the limitations present when
significant rebuilding is required, it is the reocmmended method for running
the pipeline, especially for new users.

Next steps
----------

Although the pipeline can produce nearly-complete models in favorable cases
(typically at moderate-to-high resolution, approximately 2.2 to 1.8Å), the
structures are unlikely to be truly complete.  Several recommendations for
finishing the refinement in Coot:

  - **Inspect the ligand binding closely.** A number of structures in the PDB
    have been shown to exhibit ligand placements which are not supported by
    the data, leading to several retractions so far.  Although the CC cutoff
    for ligand placement is designed to avoid this outcome, **it is essential
    that you visually confirm the refined ligand position.**  Of particular
    concern:

      - Does the difference map show residual positive or (especially) negative
        peaks around the ligand binding site?  Even if the overall position is
        approximately correct, this may indicate problems with the specific
        conformation and/or geometry; it is not uncommon, for example, for
        nearly-symmetric rings to be fit backwards.

      - Does the overall shape of the 2mFo-DFc map approximate that of the
        ligand?  If not, this could mean that the ligand has been mistakenly
        placed in density for missing protein atoms, or for another unrelated
        ligand (such as contaminants from the crystallization solution).  Note
        that it is quite possible for flexible ligands to be partially
        disordered, but in such cases the remainder of the ligand should still
        be clearly defined in the map.

      - Does the binding make biological sense?  Pay special attention to
        hydrogen bond donors and acceptors in both the ligand and the protein,
        and especially the interactions of charged groups.  Chemically
        nonsensical binding usually indicates an incorrect fit (or, in extreme
        cases, an incorrect ligand).

  - **Look for additional ligands.** It is quite common for protein structures
    to co-crystallize with buffer molecules, ions, and endogenous contaminants.
    These can be placed by running LigandFit, or interactively in Coot.

  - **Check for errors or missing pieces in the protein model.** Even after
    refinement and/or rebuilding, some local fitting problems may be present
    (especially at lower resolution).  Additionally, it is very common for
    pieces of the start model to be missing from the refined structure, or
    vice-versa; this will usually be obvious from the maps.  Alternate
    conformations will normally be stripped out before molecular replacement,
    so at high resolution (typically 1.6Å or better), these may need to be
    added manually.  You should also check the validation results to identify
    geometry problems and misfitting.

  - If none of the above steps requires further adjustments, your model is
    probably complete.  Otherwise, if you make any changes, you should run a
    final round of refinement with weight optimization to get the best possible
    model, and a final set of maps which should also be inspected.

More generally, with any automation system, two rules apply: **exercise
appropriate skepticism** and **seek expert opinion if unsure of the results**.
(If a local expert is not available, email help@phenix-online.org for advice.)

Limitations
-----------

- Only one type of ligand is supported at present.  Essential cofactors or
  other molecules whose binding mode is already known may included in the
  input model; in these cases, you should add keep_hetatms=True to instruct
  Phaser to leave the occupancies unmodified.  Any additional ligands will
  need to be placed after the final refinement.

- Structures such as HIV protease which exhibit symmetry binding of inhibitors
  will not be handled properly.

- The pipeline is designed to work at resolutions of 3.0A or better; while
  it is possible to solve complexes at lower resolution, the ligand fitting
  procedure is not expected to work as well.

- There is no high-resolution limit, but structures at atomic resolution will
  inevitably require more manual effort to complete due to the presence of
  alternate conformations and (often) additional small-molecule ligands, which
  are not presently handled by Phenix.

Troubleshooting
---------------

The pipeline may fail for a number of reasons, usually because LigandFit could
not successfully place any copies of the ligand.  If this happens, the program
will skip the final refinement step and exit early with an error message.  You
can still run the Coot script to load the output of the previous refinement
or AutoBuild, which may provide clues about the cause of failure.  Several
common problems are listed below.  Note that these may also apply to cases
where the pipeline runs to completion but was unable to place all copies of
the ligand successfully (in which case a warning message will be printed).

  - **The protein blocks the ligand site.** This is one of the most common
    problems, especially in structures which undergo extensive conformational
    changes or local rearrangements, such as kinases.  Even a single stray
    sidechain may prevent LigandFit from placing the ligand correctly, both
    due to flattened difference density, and steric clashes.  For structures
    with NCS, this can sometimes be overcome by the NCS application procedure
    described above, but this still requires that at least one copy was placed
    correctly.  Running AutoBuild can sometimes help, but this also has the
    risk of moving the protein into ligand density.  The interactive mode is
    strongly recommended for overcoming this problem.

  - **Poor or incomplete difference density.**  In some cases, a particularly
    flexible ligand may not fit entirely into difference density; this is not
    uncommon or necessarily problematic, but it can reduce the CC below the
    cutoff required to continue.  More common is poor density quality for the
    entire molecule; this can be caused by an incompletely refined model, low
    resolution, or partial binding.  In some cases, it means that the ligand
    is not bound at all.  While reducing the CC cutoff may allow some
    structures to proceed, we recommend inspecting the density interactively,
    both before and after ligand placement.

  - **Poor ligand geometry.** In some cases eLBOW is unable to automatically
    determine the optimal geometry from the inputs.  Running AM1 optimization
    may help for structures where the initial geometry is partially correct.
    However, in extreme cases the geometry will be too distorted for AM1 to
    work, and additional information on geometry is required.  For this reason,
    we recommend supplying as rich a source of information as possible;
    in particular, if geometry from a crystal structure of the target compound
    is available, this should be included in the inputs.
