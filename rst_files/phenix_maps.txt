phenix.maps: a command line tool to compute various maps and save them in most
             of known formats.

How to run the command line version:

  1. Run phenix.maps without any arguments: just type phenix.maps in the command
     line and hit Enter. This will creare a parameter file called maps.params,
     which can be renamed if desired.

  2. Edit maps.params file to specify input/output file names, data labels and
     the desired maps. It is possible to request as many maps as desired. By
     default, the file maps.params specifies 5 maps to be created: 2mFo-DFc,
     2mFo-DFc with missing Fobs filled with DFcalc, mFo-DFc and anomalous
     difference maps will be output in MTZ format, and one 2mFo-DFc map will be
     output in X-plor formatted file.
     NOTE: the anomalous difference map will only be created if the input
     reflection data file contains Bijvoet maps (F+/F- or I+/I-).

  3. Run this command to compute requested maps: phenix.maps maps.params

Important Facts:

  - phenix.maps is available in PHENIX GUI.

  - The scope of parameters 'map_coefficients' defines the map that will be
    output as Fourier map coefficients. The scope of parameters 'map' defines
    the map that will be output as X-plor formatted map.

  - To create several maps: duplicate either 'map_coefficients' or 'map' or both
    scopes of parameters as many times as many maps is desired. Then edit each
    of them to define the maps.

  - A map is defined by specifying a map type using 'map_type' keyword available
    within each scope of parameters: 'map_coefficients' or 'map'. The general
    supported format for 'map_type' is: [p][m]Fo+[q][D]Fc[_kick][_filled]. For
    example: 2Fo-Fc, 2mFobs-DFcalc, 3Fobs-2Fmodel, Fo-Fc, mfobs-Dfcalc, anom.
    The 'map_type' parser will automatically recognize which map is requested.

  - The program creates as many files with X-plor formatted maps as many X-plor
    formatted maps is requested, and it creates only one MTZ formatted file with
    all Fourier map coefficients in it.

  - The X-plor formatted map can be computed in the entire unit cell or around
    selected atoms only.

  - Kick maps and missing Fobs filling is done (if requested) as described in
    Adams et al. (2010). Acta Cryst. D66, 213-221.

  - Twinning (if detected) will be accounted for automatically. This can be
    disabled by using "skip_twin_detection=True" keyword.

  - All arrays used in map calculation, for example: Fobs, Fmodel, Fcalc, Fmask,
    m, D, etc., can be output into a CNS or MTZ formatted reflection file.

  - For those who likes to experiment: bulk solvent correction and anisotropic
    scaling can be turned off, the data can be filtered by sigma and resolution.

  - For some map types certain 'map_coefficients' or 'map' scope parameters may
    not be applicable. For example, for "map_type=anomalous" the keywords
    "kicked", "fill_missing_f_obs" and some other are not applicable.
