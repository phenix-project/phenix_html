Install Cryo_fit
===============================

.. contents::

1. Install Phenix
-----------------------
See the `installation notes for Phenix <../install-setup-run.html>`__


2. Link cryo_fit to phenix
-------------------------------

At <user phenix>/modules

::

    git clone git@github.com:cryoFIT/cryo_fit.git

At any folder,

:: 

    libtbx.configure cryo_fit


3. Install gromacs_cryo_fit
-------------------------------
Download gromacs-4.5.5_cryo_fit.zip from `here <https://github.com/cryoFIT/cryo_fit_install>`__

.. image:: ../images/cryo_fit_download_1.png

.. image:: ../images/cryo_fit_download_2.png

Install using a provided script. 

::
   
   python <user phenix>/modules/cryo_fit/files_for_steps/0_install_cryo_fit/install_cryo_fit.py
   <cryo_fit.zip> <install_path>

If install_path doesn't exist when a user specified it, new folder with that name will be created (confirmed at macOS 10.13.6)


Please use absolute path, for example,

:: 

   python
   /Users/doonam/bin/phenix-dev-2906/modules/cryo_fit/files_for_steps/0_install_cryo_fit/install_cryo_fit.py
   ~/Downloads/gromacs-4.5.5_cryo_fit.zip ~/cryo_fit

will work.


Relative path like

:: 

   python
   /Users/doonam/bin/phenix-dev-2906/modules/cryo_fit/files_for_steps/0_install_cryo_fit/install_cryo_fit.py
   ~/Downloads/gromacs-4.5.5_cryo_fit.zip ..

doesn't work.


4. Troubleshooting
-------------------------------
- If user's OS doesn't have git 

  - `install git <https://git-scm.com/book/id/v2/Getting>`_

- If a user sees the error message during git clone, “Permission
  denied (publickey).fatal: Could not read from remote repository. Please make sure you have the correct access rights and the repository exists.”,

  - user’s computer needs to be registered to his/her github account. Therefore, make github account (free), `Generate a new SSH key <https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent>`__ and `Add a new SSH key to your GitHub account <https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account>`__


- If user's macOS shows, “xcode-select: note: no developer tools were
  found at '/Applications/Xcode.app', requesting install. Choose an option in the dialog to download the command line developer tools.”

  - download commandline as instructed (this may take ~7 minutes)


- “-bash: libtbx.configure: command not found”

  - (in commandline)
  
  - export PATH="/Users/.../phenix-xxxx/build/bin":$PATH
  
  - source /Users/.../phenix-xxxx/phenix_env.sh
  
  - libtbx.configure cryo_fit
