4. Troubleshooting
-------------------------------
If user's OS doesn't have git 

-> `install git
<https://git-scm.com/book/id/v2/Getting>`_

If a user sees the error during git clone,
“Permission denied (publickey).fatal: Could not read from remote
repository. Please make sure you have the correct access rights and
the repository exists.”,

-> user’s computer needs to be registered to his/her github account. Therefore, make github account (free), `Generate a new SSH key <https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent>`__ and `Add a new SSH key to your GitHub account <https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account>`__


If user's macOS shows, “xcode-select: note: no developer tools were
found at '/Applications/Xcode.app', requesting install. Choose an
option in the dialog to download the command line developer tools.”

::

   download commandline as instructed (this may take ~7 minutes)


“-bash: libtbx.configure: command not found”

::

   Run export PATH="/Users/.../phenix-xxxx/build/bin":$PATH
   source /Users/.../phenix-xxxx/phenix_env.sh
   in commandline, and try “libtbx.configure cryo_fit” again


“subprocess.CalledProcessError: Command '['which',
'phenix.cryo_fit’]’”

:: 

 It can’t find phenix.cryo_fit, link (sync) cryo_fit by “libtbx.configure cryo_fit”. 
 Open a new tab in your terminal (like iterm2), then your .bash_profile should run freshly.
