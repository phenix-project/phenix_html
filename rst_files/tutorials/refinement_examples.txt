Quick Facts
-----------

- All necessary files to run structure refinement examples with phenix.refine
  are located in ``refinement_examples`` directory;
- Each sub-directory ``refinement_examples/example_xx`` contains all task files
  (command and parameter files) necessary to run an example;
- Data and model files are located in ``refinement_examples/data`` sub-directory;
- Some examples are quick to run and some could take an hour or more
  (depending on computer);
- The actual R-factors resulted from running these examples may slightly vary
  from listed below due to potential differences in hardware and software
  (different versions of compilers or PHENIX).

Run examples
------------

There are two different ways to run the examples:

1. Type the command::

     % phenix.run_refinement_example 5a

   this will create the directory ``example_5a`` and run the example 5a in this
   directory. Running the command above without arguments will run all examples
   (will take a long time). One can also run several examples like this::

     % phenix.run_refinement_example 1a 2b 3a 3c

   this will create 4 directories: ``example_1a``, ..., ``example_3c`` and run
   the examples 1a, 2b, 3a and 3c in these directories.

2. From PHENIX distribution copy the entire ``refinement_examples`` directory
   to where you plan to run the examples. Then go to any of sub-directories
   ``refinement_examples/example_xx`` and execute a run file. This will start
   the selected refinement example, wait until it's finished and inspect the
   output files.


Examples
--------

**Refinement of 1akg structure at 1.1 A resolution**

  In this series of examples we review the simple refinement with all default
  parameters, automatic picking and refinement of solvent molecules, switching
  from isotropic to anisotropic ADP refinement, practice monitoring of Rfactors
  change during refinement and experience the effect of adding and refinement
  of hydrogen atoms.

  **example_1a:** The simplest possible refinement mode: refinement with all
  default parameters. This includes 3 macro-cycles of bulk-solvent and
  anisotropic scaling, individual coordinates and isotropic B-factors
  refinement, refinement of occupancies for atoms in alternative conformations.

    Final: R-work = 0.2264 R-free = 0.2423

  The start model does not contain any water molecules placed into it. Next
  example demonstrates how to add and refine ordered solvent.

  **example_1b:** Same refinement run as in example_1a with automatic water
  picking and refinement.

    Final: R-work = 0.1771 R-free = 0.1855

  Automatic water picking and refinement dropped the R-factors by ~5%. At 1.1 A
  resolution all well ordered non-hydrogen atoms should be refined as
  anisotropic.

  **example_1c:** Same refinement run as in example_1b with all non-water atoms
  refined anisotropically.

    Final: R-work = 0.1534 R-free = 0.1849

  Refinement of non-solvent atoms as anisotropic dropped both Rwork and Rfree (
  as expected at this resolution).

  **example_1d:** Same refinement run as in example_1c performed with hydrogen
  atoms added to the start model.

    Final: R-work = 0.1426 R-free = 0.1703

  Using the hydrogens in refinement may further improve the model. Indeed,
  adding the hydrogen atoms and refining them as riding model decreased
  R-factors by approximately 1%.

  **example_1e:** Same refinement run as in example_1d performed with optimized
  X-ray target weights for both coordinate and ADP refinement.

    Final: R-work = 0.1340 R-free = 0.1658

  Although phenix.refine uses automatic procedure for relative xray/geometry
  weight calculation and finds good weights in most of cases, it may be a good
  idea to try to optimize the weights. A drop in R-factors by ~1% in this
  example clearly demonstrates this. Since it is very slow, this option is
  recommended to run overnight for a final model tune up.

**Refinement of 1071B at 3.0A resolution, 2 NCS groups with 3 components in each group.**

  The aim of these four examples below is to practice determining and specifying
  of NCS groups (using atom selection syntax). Also it underlines the importance
  of checking NCS groups that determined automatically by phenix.refine. The
  last example demonstrates the use of TLS.

  **example_2a:** Refinement with all default parameters. This includes 3
  macro-cycles of bulk-solvent and anisotropic scaling, coordinates and
  individual isotropic B-factors refinement.

    Final: R-work = 0.2082 R-free = 0.2729

  The number of parameters and relatively low resolution produce fairly large
  gap between R-work and R-free. Hopefully we can add some more "observations"
  by using NCS restraints.

  **example_2b:** Same refinement run as in example_2a with using the NCS
  restraints (NCS operators detected automatically).

    Final: R-work = 0.2404 R-free = 0.2839

  phenix.refine can automatically determine NCS groups and set up the selections
  for NCS restraints. It does it by simple analysis of chains in input PDB.
  Although it does the good job in many cases, in this particular one the found
  selections are not optimal and their use in refinement is counterproductive:
  both R-work and R-free jumped up. Visual inspection of the model on graphics
  suggests more smart selections as demonstrated below.

  **example_2c:** Same refinement run as in example_2a with using the NCS
  restraints (NCS operators provided manually).

    Final: R-work = 0.2147 R-free = 0.2566

  The correct selections for NCS groups and their use in refinement produce
  nice R-factors.

  **example_2d:** Same refinement run as in example_2c with using TLS to model
  ADP of selected domains.

  The use of TLS model for ADP of selected chains results in some further model
  improvement.

    Final: R-work = 0.2079 R-free = 0.2540


**Refinement of 1038B at 3.0A resolution, 10 fold NCS.**

  These three examples below are similar to previous set of examples with two
  main differences: the automatic determination of NCS groups worked well and
  the use of TLS modeling resulted in more significant improvement.

  **example_3a:** Refinement with all default parameters. This includes 3
  macro-cycles of bulk-solvent and anisotropic scaling, coordinates and
  individual isotropic B-factors refinement.

    Final: R-work = 0.2043 R-free = 0.2743

  The gap between R-work and R-free clearly indicated the overfitting. The NCS
  restraints will help as shown in the next example.

  **example_3b:** Same refinement run as in example_3a with using the NCS
  restraints (NCS operators detected automatically).

    Final: R-work = 0.2207 R-free = 0.2527

  Applying NCS restrains decreased R-free and narrowed the gap R-work - R-free.
  No manual work was necessary to specify NCS groups.

  **example_3c:** Same refinement run as in example_3b with using TLS to model
  ADP of selected domains.

    Final: r_work = 0.2008 r_free = 0.2410

  Selecting TLS groups required a closer look at the model on graphics. This
  is rewarded by ~2% drop in R. Note that the refinement is not fully converged
  as indicated by continuous drop in R-factors between the last two macro-cycles
  (see PDB file header: in refinement statistics step-by-step). This suggests
  that adding a few more refinement macro-cycles may further improve the model.

**Refinement using Simulated Annealing (SA)**

  In this couple of examples we demonstrate the power of SA refinement to
  improve a poor starting model. Combining it with automatic water picking is
  a good idea at the cost of just one parameter added to the command line.

  **example_4a:** Refinement with all default parameters. This includes 3
  macro-cycles of bulk-solvent and anisotropic scaling, coordinates and
  individual isotropic B-factors refinement.

  Start: r_work = 0.4166 r_free = 0.4678
  Final: r_work = 0.3621 r_free = 0.4188

  The default refinement run (plus water picking) did a good progress in model
  improvement.

  **example_4b:** Same refinement run as in example_4a with using SA.

  Start: r_work = 0.4166 r_free = 0.4678
  Final: r_work = 0.2771 r_free = 0.3414

  Adding a SA refinement to the previous refinement run results in big model
  improvement as indicated by drop in both R-work and R-free factors.

**Refinement of f' and f'' for a structure with unknown (to the dictionary) molecule in it**

  The goal of this example is to show that in case of refinement against
  anomalous data the refinement of f' and f'' to model the anomalous
  differences in F+ and F- may deliver another drop in R-factors from small
  fractions to ~1% or more. Also it shows how to use eLBOW program to generate
  a CIF (stereochemistry dictionary) file for the unknown item in the input PDB.
  A PDB entry with the code 1mdg is used in this example.

  **example_5a:** Refinement with all default parameters. This includes 3
  macro-cycles of bulk-solvent and anisotropic scaling, coordinates and
  individual isotropic B-factors refinement.

    Final: R-work = 0.1944 R-free = 0.2368

  **example_5b:** Same refinement run as in example_5a with f' and f''
  refinement for anomalous scatterer.

    Final: R-work = 0.1900 R-free = 0.2287

  Note the drop in both R and R-free.


**Refinement using twinned data**

  This example shows how to do the refinement if the data is twinned.
  phenix.xtriage was used to obtain the twinning operator. For more information
  about twinning analysis and using in refinement look separate paragraph in
  PHENIX documentation.

  **example_6a:** Refinement with all default parameters. This includes 3
  macro-cycles of bulk-solvent and anisotropic scaling, coordinates and
  individual isotropic B-factors refinement. A PDB entry with the code 1l2h is
  used in this example.

    Final: R-work = 0.2476 R-free = 0.2755

  **example_6b:** Same refinement run as in example_6a with the twinning taken
  into account.

    Final: R-work = 0.1640 R-free = 0.2069
