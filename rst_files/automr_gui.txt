==============================
The AutoMR graphical interface
==============================

AutoMR is a simplified frontend to the molecular replacement program Phaser.
It is generally the starting point for running MR in Phenix, due to its ease
of use and interaction with other programs (such as `AutoBuild
<autobuild_gui.htm>`_).  For very advanced cases, the `Phaser-MR GUI
<phaser_mr.htm>`_ may be used instead.

If you have not previously used Phenix and/or Phaser for molecular replacement,
we recommend that you start by reading the `overview page <mr_overview.htm>`_,
which explains some of the concepts and terminology used by Phaser, as well
as guidelines for its use.  This document only summarizes the function of the
AutoMR GUI itself; more detailed information on program behavior may be found
in the `command-line documentation <automr.htm>`_ and `Phaser documentation
<phaser.htm>`_.

Preparing for molecular replacement
-----------------------------------

See the `overview page <mr_overview.htm>`_ for approximate rules for when
MR will be successful.  Unless you have a high-sequence-identity model and
are relatively certain of the conformation, it is important to prepare the
model(s) by running them through the `Sculptor <sculptor.htm>`_ utility before
running AutoMR.  If you want to try to increase sensitivity by using an
ensemble of related structures, you should use `Ensembler <ensembler.htm>`_
to superpose them in the same orientation, as AutoMR will not do this
automatically.

Input and configuration
-----------------------

In the Phenix GUI, there are two interfaces available for AutoMR: one for
single-component searches, and one for multi-part structures.  The former is
shown below:

.. image:: images/automr_simple.png

Files may be added by dragging them into the list widget at top of the window.
This interface is more intuitive and easier to set up, but only allows a single
search model; if multiple PDB files are supplied, these will be treated as
parts of one ensemble, not separate components to search for.  A reflections
file (amplitudes or intensities, plus sigmas) and at least one PDB file are
required.  A sequence file may be used to specify the composition (it will
also be sent to AutoBuild if model-building is requested), or you may enter
the molecular weight below.  A list of either RMSDs or sequence identities for
each model in the ensemble is required.

The multi-ensemble version splits the file input into separate controls:

.. image:: images/automr_main1.png

You may use as many ensembles as you want; each of these may contain multiple
related PDB files.  The composition is entered in a separate tab:

.. image:: images/automr_main2.png

The number of composition entries and the number of ensembles do not need to
be identical; you may simply specify an overall molecular weight if you prefer,
rather than entering each sequence individually.

Output
------

Once Phaser starts running, a tab will appear showing search progress and
summary output:

.. image:: images/automr_status.png

At the end of the run, a result tab will appear listing files,

.. image:: images/automr_result.png

As a general rule, the LLG should be as high as possible (for a very good
solution, values above 1000 are common).  If the LLG is negative, this
essentially means that the model performed as well as would be expected for
randomly placed atoms.  The final translation function Z-score (TFZ) is also
important, and can be found in the logfile or Phaser summary output.  A TFZ
above 8 usually means that MR was successful.

Only two output files will be generated, an MTZ file (MR.1.mtz) containing
phases, and a PDB file containing the placed ensembles.  If each ensemble
consists of only a single model, the PDB file may be directly used for
refinement; otherwise, we recommend running AutoBuild first.  Although the
MTZ file contains F and SIGF values, these are anisotropy-corrected and should
not be used for refinement.  Clicking any of the graphics viewer buttons will
open both files, with the weighted map coefficients generated by Phaser
displayed.  The maps are usually very noisy (and if a high-resolution cutoff
was imposed, this will also be applied), but inspecting the crystal packing may
provide additional clues to whether MR was successful.

Next steps
----------

The model and maps obtained by molecular replacement are usually not directly
useful for manual rebuilding or ligand placement, since they often are
generated at a lower resolution limit and have undergone only minimal
rigid-body refinement.  Either automated model-building in `AutoBuild
<autobuild_gui.htm>`_ or full refinement in `phenix.refine <refine_gui.htm>`_ is
usually appropriate, depending on data quality and similarity of
the search model(s) to the crystallized protein(s).  For refinement, a
combination of rigid-body, individual sites, and individual ADPs is usually
recommended, except at low resolution where grouped ADPs may be necessary.
Simulated annealing may also be very helpful at this stage.

For very marginal solutions, if you are confident of the approximate placement
of the model(s) but automated rebuilding and/or refinement fails, the
`MR-Rosetta <mr_rosetta.htm>`_ protocol is able to improve a poor map by
extensive optimization of the model with an electron-density target.

MR-SAD
------

In situations where neither molecular replacement nor SAD phasing yields
high-quality phases independently, the two procedures may be combined by
running AutoMR followed by AutoSol.  The phases from MR will be used to
locate heavy atom sites in anomalous data, and combined with the experimental
phases.  To perform this in Phenix, all you need is to run AutoMR with your
anomalous data, then click the "Run MR-SAD" button in the result tab.  This
will launch AutoSol with the input reflections and MR phases already loaded.
