Frequently asked questions for phenix.refine
============================================

Note: questions specific to the GUI can be found in its
`documentation <refine_gui.htm>`_.

**Where is the switch for anisotropic vs. isotropic B-factors/ADPs?**

phenix.refine does not have a single global switch for defining ADP
parameterization; rather, when the "Individual ADPs" strategy is defined,
the program uses several criteria to determine how atoms should be
treated:

  - By default, atoms that are anisotropic in the input model (i.e. have
    ANISOU records) will be kept anisotropic if the resolution is at least
    1.7A; isotropic atoms remain isotropic.
  - If the resolution is lower, all atoms will be converted to isotropic
    unless otherwise specified.
  - The atom selections for isotropic and anisotropic atoms may also be
    defined explicitly.  Typically, the hydrogens will always be isotropic;
    protein atoms will be anisotropic at high resolution, and sometimes
    waters as well.

In the GUI, several common parameterizations are pre-defined in the dialog for
entering ADP selections.  Note that although it is possible to combine
all of the different ADP refinement strategies in a single run, the
atom selections for individual and grouped refinement may not overlap,
nor may the selections for anisotropic ADPs and TLS groups.

**My resolution is X Angstroms, and my R/R-free are Y and Z.  Am I done refining?**

A partial answer can be obtained by looking at the
`POLYGON tool in the validation summary <validation.htm#polygon>`_, which
plots histograms of statistics for PDB structures solved at similar
resolutions, and compares these to the statistics for your output model.
As a general rule, R-factors alone should not be used to decide if a
structure is "done", but should be examined in combination with the
validation report.

**My resolution is X Angstroms, the structure is complete and
well-validated, the maps look great, bu my R and R-free are still really
high.  How can I make them lower?**

There are several possible explanations for this:

  - Twinning with a relatively small twin fraction (perhaps 10%) may not
    obviously affect map quality, but can still have a significant impact
    on R-factors.  Run `Xtriage <xtriage_gui.htm>`_ to look for evidence
    of twinning, and possible twin laws for using in phenix.refine.  (Note
    that we currently only support a single twin domain in refinement.)
  - Undiagnosed translational NCS (AKA translational pseudosymmetry) can
    have a similar effect.  In this case, the diffraction images may have
    been processed incorrectly, thus missing the fainter spots that result
    from tNCS.  The program `LABELIT <http://cci.lbl.gov/labelit/>`_, or
    more specifically the command *labelit.index* (distributed with
    PHENIX, but not yet available in the GUI) can be run on the original
    images to provide appropriate indexing parameters.

**The gap between R-work and R-free is very large - how can I fix this?**

Overfitting during refinement is usually helped by adding more restraints,
and/or tightening the standard geometry restraints.  If the output geometry
is already within reasonable limits (typically RMS(bonds) < 0.016 and
RMS(angles) < 1.8), ideas to try include adding NCS restraints if NCS is
present, secondary structure restraints, or reference model restraints (if
a high-resolution structure is available).  At lower resolutions (worse
than 3.0A), it may also be prudent to try grouped ADP refinement, and if
desperate, Ramachandran restraints.  TLS refinement can often improve
overfitting across a wide range of resolutions.  However, depending on the
degree of overfitting, it may be necessary to perform extensive manual
rebuilding first.  *(Note that if the large R/R-free gap suddenly appears
after refinement of a model that was previously not overfit, this usually
indicates incorrect parameterization of the refinement, e.g. using
anisotropic ADPs at an inappropriate resolution.)*

**Why is phenix.refine messing up my ligand geometry?**

This often happens
when the restraints were generated using `ReadySet <ready_set.htm>`_ from a
PDB file, and
the ligand code is not recognizable in the Chemical Components Database.
`eLBOW <elbow_gui.htm>`_ will try to guess the molecular topology based on
the coordinates alone, but this is imprecise and may not yield the desired
result.  For best results, restraints for non-standard ligands should be
generated in eLBOW using a SMILES string or similar source of topology
information.

**I have experimental phases for this structure, but the initial maps were
poor.  Should I still use phase restraints?**

The experimental phases
used to restraint refinement describe a bimodal probability distribution
for every angle, rather than the single values used to generate a map.  In
most cases the additional restraints will not hurt refinement, and can
often help.
