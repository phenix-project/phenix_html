Purpose
-------

The purpose of analyze_alt_conf is to analyze alternative 
conformations (focusing on side-chains)
for a structure and an optional comparison structure.

The problem that it solves is that if you have multiple conformations present
in two structures, identifying which ones match and which ones are unique
is tedious.

How analyze_alt_conf works:
--------------------------

This tool first superposes all models that are supplied.  Then
it analyzes the unique residue conformations in each 
model that is supplied.  Residues that superpose with an rmsd of
min_rotamer_rmsd (default of 0.25 A) or better are considered the same
conformer; those with a larger rmsd are considered different.

If there are two models supplied, the tool then compares the unique 
conformers in the first and second models.  It identifies
which altlocs in the first model (m1) match which altlocs in the
second model (m2), and which are unique in one model or the other.

Examples
--------

Standard run of analyze_alt_conf:
--------------------------------

Running analyze_alt_conf is easy. From the command-line you can type:

::

  phenix.analyze_alt_conf model.pdb other_model.pdb

where model.pdb is the model you would like to use as a starting point and
other_model.pdb is an optional comparison model.

Possible Problems
-----------------

The procedure only analyzes alternative side-chain conformers, not main-chain.
If you main chain has substantial alternative conformations (not just
slight adjustments to match the side chain conformers), you will need to use
another approach.
