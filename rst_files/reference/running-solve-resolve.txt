Purpose
-------

SOLVE and RESOLVE can be run directly in the PHENIX environment. This
feature is normally only for advanced SOLVE/RESOLVE users who want to
access the keywords in SOLVE/RESOLVE directly.

Usage
-----

Running SOLVE/RESOLVE from the command-line or in a script.
-----------------------------------------------------------

-  You can run solve with the command:

::

    phenix.solve

This command will set the environmental variables CCP4\_OPEN, SYMOP,
SYMLIB, and SOLVEDIR and will run solve. If you want to run a different
size of solve, then you can specify:

::

    phenix.solve --giant

For a bigger version still, choose --huge, for biggest, --extra\_huge.

-  Running resolve or resolve\_pattern is similar:

::

    phenix.resolve
    phenix.resolve_pattern

-  Running solve/resolve from a command file is simple. Here is a
   command file to run resolve:

::

    phenix.resolve<<EOD
    hklin solve.mtz
    labin FP=FP SIGFP=SIGFP PHIB=PHIB FOM=FOM HLA=HLA HLB=HLB HLC=HLC HLD=HLD
    solvent_content 0.43
    database 5
    EOD

All the solve/resolve keywords are available in the PHENIX versions of
solve and resolve. See the full documentation for solve/resolve at
