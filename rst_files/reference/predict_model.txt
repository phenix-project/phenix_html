Purpose
-------

Predict model can be used to generate predicted models from a sequence file.
One predicted model is generated for each unique sequence.

Sequence file
-------------

The sequence file that you supply specifies what is going to be predicted and
how many copies of each chain are present in the structure (one for every copy
in the sequence file).  All models that are created and input will be associated
with one or more of the chains in your sequence file based on sequence 
identity (normally every model should match a chain in the sequence file
exactly).

Model prediction
----------------

Predict model normally uses either a Phenix server or a Google Colab
notebook to carry out AlphaFold prediction of one chain at a time. 

The general procedure is to create a set of files that specify all the
necessary inputs for model prediction (a sequence file, optional multiple
sequence alignment file, optional templates, keywords for model prediction
such as the number of models to generate, random seed, whether to use a
multiple sequence alignment) and to package all these files in a single
zipped tar (.tgz) file.  

If the Phenix server is specified, the Phenix GUI will use the Phenix server
to carry out the prediction and put it in the working directory. This is the
normal way to use this tool.

If Colab is specified, the Phenix GUI will provide a
button that opens Google Colab in a browser, then you start the Colab 
notebook and upload the zipped tar file. The notebook runs the prediction
and downloads a .zip file with the results.  The Phenix GUI recognizes this
file, opens it and puts the new prediction in the working directory. This
directory is specified by the unique jobname that you provide for your work.
You will need to be logged in to a Google account for this to work.

When prediction is being carried out, the Phenix GUI waits for the predicted
models to appear in the working directory, then it writes out the resulting
models.

MSA calculation vs model prediction
-----------------------------------

If you use the Phenix server, the calculation of multiple sequence alignments
(MSAs) is a separate step from model prediction.  The Phenix GUI
on your computer sends a request to the mmseqs2 server, which creates an MSA
and sends it back to your computer. Then your computer uploads the MSA to
the Phenix server, which uses it in an AlphaFold prediction.

If you want, you can supply your own MSAs. The key requirement is that the
sequence of the first entry in your MSA must exactly match the sequence to be
predicted.

You can also skip the use of MSAs. This can be useful if you supply a template
and you want AlphaFold to rebuild your template instead of doing a new
prediction.

Number of models
----------------

AlphaFold can carry out multiple predictions for a sequence.  You can specify
how many of these to carry out.  The PredictModel tool will choose the one with
the highest value of pLDDT (predicted local difference distance test).

Using templates from the PDB
----------------------------

You can request that templates from the PDB be used in prediction. If you use
this feature, models will be predicted both with and without the templates, and
the model with the highest pLDDT will be saved.

Using supplied templates
------------------------

You can supply your own templates. As for templates from the PDB, if you use
this feature, models will be predicted both with and without the templates, and
the model with the highest pLDDT will be saved.


Precalculated MSAs and models save time if you rerun with the same sequence
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

When you run a prediction on the Phenix server, it saves the MSA and the
predicted model.  Then if you run the same request again (same number of
AlphaFold models, same sequence, same choice of including templates from the
PDB, no supplied template), the server will return the result from the
original run.  You can turn this off with the precalculated results and
precalculated MSA keywords if you want.  Note that the server does not save
your sequence or parameters. It just makes a hash string from them so that
if the same request is made again it can detect it. The results are simply saved
in a file that has the hash string as a name.

Precalculated MSAs and models allow you go get your result even if disconnected 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you get disconnected from the server during a prediction job, you can just 
wait for the job to finish, then submit a new request with the same parameters.
As the server saves the predictions, it will return the result to you right
away (if it is finished).

Examples
--------

Standard run of predict_model
---------------------------------

Running predict_model is easy. From the command-line you can type:

::

    phenix.predict_and_build jobname=myjob seq_file=seq.dat \
      prediction_server=PhenixServer \
      stop_after_predict=True rest_server.url=http://my_rest_server:2320/

Server problems
---------------

The most common problem in running Predict model is that either the Phenix
server or the Colab server is not working as expected.  Normally the first thing
to try is just let the program retry (it will do this for a while normally).
If that is not working, you can stop the program (abort in the GUI), and 
run again with the same parameters (i.e., the same jobname) except changing 
the server from PhenixServer to Colab or vice-versa.  That will give you another
chance.  If neither server is working, you can take the files in the packaged
.tgz file (listed in the GUI output), use them to get your own prediction with
any server, and put the resulting predicted models in the place specified in 
the GUI or program output.
