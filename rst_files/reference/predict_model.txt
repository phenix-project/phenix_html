A tutorial video for `AlphaFold prediction <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6y-wXnwZYM>`_ is available on the `Phenix YouTube channel <https://www.youtube.com/c/phenixtutorials>`_ and covers the following topics:

- basic overview of AlphaFold model prediction
- how to run PredictModel with the Phenix AlphaFold server using the Phenix GUI
- how to interpret the output


Purpose
-------

Predict model can be used to generate predicted models from a sequence file.
One predicted model is generated for each unique sequence.

You can choose whether to use a multiple sequence alignment (MSA), whether
go use templates from the PDB, and whether to supply your own template to be
used as a guide in prediction.

Sequence file
-------------

The sequence file that you supply specifies what is going to be predicted and
how many copies of each chain are present in the structure (one for every copy
in the sequence file).  All models that are created and input will be associated
with one or more of the chains in your sequence file based on sequence 
identity (normally every model should match a chain in the sequence file
exactly).

Model prediction
----------------

Predict model normally uses the Phenix server
notebook to carry out AlphaFold prediction of one chain at a time. 

You can specify what inputs the AlphaFold prediction should use.  These
always include a sequence file, but it can include an optional multiple
sequence alignment file, optional templates, keywords for model prediction
such as the number of models to generate, random seed, and whether to use
multiple sequence alignment.

When prediction is being carried out, the Phenix GUI waits for the predicted
models to appear in the working directory, then it writes out the resulting
models.

Using the Phenix server for model prediction
--------------------------------------------

Prediction is fully automated with the Phenix server through the Phenix GUI,
so all you have to do is let it run.  The Phenix GUI will use the Phenix
server to carry out the prediction and put it in the working directory.


MSA calculation vs model prediction
-----------------------------------

The calculation of multiple sequence alignments
(MSAs) is a separate step from model prediction.  The Phenix GUI
on your computer sends a request to the mmseqs2 server, which creates an MSA
and sends it back to your computer. Then your computer uploads the MSA to
the Phenix server, which uses it in an AlphaFold prediction.

If you want, you can supply your own MSAs. The key requirement is that the
sequence of the first entry in your MSA must exactly match the sequence to be
predicted.

You can also skip the use of MSAs. This can be useful if you supply a template
and you want AlphaFold to rebuild your template instead of doing a new
prediction.

Number of models
----------------

AlphaFold can carry out multiple predictions for a sequence.  You can specify
how many of these to carry out.  The PredictModel tool will choose the one with
the highest value of pLDDT (predicted local difference distance test,
Mariani et al., 2013). Normally
the default (5 models) is a reasonable compromise between optimal prediction and
the length of time needed to carry out the prediction.  Note that the Phenix
server will stop carrying out predictions if it appears
unlikely that further predictions will significantly improve the pLDDT (the
estimate is based on the variability of pLDDT values so far.)

Using templates from the PDB
----------------------------

You can request that templates from the PDB be used in prediction. If you use
this feature, models will be predicted both with and without the templates, and
the model with the highest pLDDT will be saved.

Using supplied templates
------------------------

You can supply your own templates. As for templates from the PDB, if you use
this feature, models will be predicted both with and without the templates, and
the model with the highest pLDDT will be saved.

Predicting very long sequences in chunks and reassembling
---------------------------------------------------------

Sequences longer than about 1500 residues take quite a long time to run. By
default if your sequence is more than 1500 residues it will be split into
overlapping chunks of length 600 with an overlap of 200.  These chunks will
be run individually, then reassembled at the end.  To improve the contacts
between domains in different chunks, a contact map is created and domains that
are in contact but in different chunks are re-predicted together. During
assembly the domain pairs are used to adjust the positions of domains, and also
positions of domains are adjusted to minimize overlaps.  The repositioned
domains are then used as a template to morph the full reassembled prediction. 
The result of this procedure is to assemble a full-length prediction from
overlapping chunk predictions and to distort this assembled prediction to
minimize overlaps and make domain-domain contacts present between chunks.

Note that if you have a sequence longer than the threshold for breaking into
chunks then you can only include one sequence in a PredictModel run. 

Precalculated MSAs and models save time if you rerun with the same sequence
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

When you run a prediction on the Phenix server, it saves the MSA and the
predicted model.  Then if you run the same request again (same number of
AlphaFold models, same sequence, same choice of including templates from the
PDB, no supplied template), the server will return the result from the
original run.  You can turn this off with the precalculated results and
precalculated MSA keywords if you want.  Note that the server does not save
your sequence or parameters. It just makes a hash string from them so that
if the same request is made again it can detect it. The results are simply saved
in a file that has the hash string as a name.

Precalculated MSAs and models allow you go get your result even if disconnected 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you get disconnected from the server during a prediction job, you can just 
wait for the job to finish, then submit a new request with the same parameters.
As the server saves the predictions, it will return the result to you right
away (if it is finished).

Using AlphaFold to improve a model you already have
---------------------------------------------------

As AlphaFold often produces models with quite good geometry, you can use it
as a procedure for geometry optimization.  You supply your working model and
your sequence, and you turn off the use of MSAs and the use of templates from
the PDB. Of course AlphaFold does not know about your density map, so it could
move the model away from the density.  Normally you would use refinement
to help with this.

Using AlphaFold to build parts of a model that are missing
----------------------------------------------------------

If you want AlphaFold to try and build the missing parts of a chain that
you have partially built, supply your working partial model and your sequence,
and allow the use of MSAs (and optionally, the use of templates from the PDB).
Your working model will be used as a template for the part of the structure
that you have already built.  Note that you have to have the correct sequence
for your partially-built model.

Notes on using the Phenix server from the Phenix GUI for model prediction
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Phenix GUI can automatically send a request to the Phenix server for an
AlphaFold prediction.  This requires an internet connection, the Phenix server
to be up, and a token that is supplied with Phenix. 

If the Phenix GUI 
successfully communicates with the server, it will wait for the server to 
carry out the prediction, showing the status of the prediction while it is
being carried out. The status will usually start out as waiting in the queue for
a place on the GPU. If this status lasts more than a few seconds, an estimated
waiting time (before starting processing) is displayed in the Phenix GUI.
The waiting time is very approximate. It is based on how long previous jobs
waited to start and how many jobs are ahead of yours.  If the currently-running
jobs happen to take a very short or long time, the estimate could be off in
either direction. If you submit more than one job at a time, the first job you
submit will get higher priority and may move nearer the front of the queue than
the others.

Once your job starts, the status in the Phenix GUI will change to reflect that is
is running.  There won't be an estimated run time shown, but most of the time
jobs with a few hundred residues take 10-20 min, and longer sequences take more or
less proportionally longer.  If you include templates from the PDB, it takes
longer to run. If you specify that the number of AlphaFold models to use is more
than the default (5), it will also take longer.

If your prediction is successful, the Phenix GUI will list the 
estimated confidence (pLDDT) and the output data files.  The output files include
the AlphaFold model (named something like PredictAndBuild_10_ALPHAFOLD_A.pdb), the
multiple sequence alignment used (PredictAndBuild_10_ALPHAFOLD_A_MSA.a3m),
and the Predicted Aligned Error (PAE) file (PredictAndBuild_10_ALPHAFOLD_A_PAE.jsn).

Privacy of your data when using the Phenix server
-------------------------------------------------

When you run the Phenix server to get an AlphaFold prediction, your data are
uploaded by the Phenix GUI to the Phenix server, the prediction is carried out,
and then the results are downloaded. 

Normally your sequence is also 
sent to the mmseqs2 MSA server to obtain a multiple sequence alignment. You
can also supply your own MSA and then the mmseqs2 server is not used. The
MSA and the hashed sequence are sent to the Phenix server and are saved
unless you specify allow_precalculated_msa_file=False.

When the job is completed and Phenix downloads the data, all data is
deleted if you specify allow_precalculated_result_file=False.
If you specify allow_precalculated_result_file=True (default),
a hashed version of the
inputs (sequence, number of models, etc) is saved along with the result
(the AlphaFold model). In this way it is not possible to see the inputs, 
but if you run the exact same job again, the server will see that the
hash of the inputs matches and it will return the model directly.

Here are some details on the privacy of your data when using the
Phenix server:

::

   Accessible only from Phenix

   Password-protected (password supplied by Phenix)

   Server provides Phenix with a passkey when data are uploaded.  
   That passkey allows download of the data. All this is done within Phenix.

   Phenix sends your IP address to the server. This is used as a unique
   identifier in the queueing system.  The IP address is deleted when the
   data are downloaded.

   Server is accessible in two modes (user can choose, default is Mode 1 
   (save hashed inputs and results).

   A. Mode 1: hashed inputs and results saved on server
     a. in this mode if anyone submits the identical job (identical 
        sequence, identical parameters) later, they get back the 
        result model from this job
     b. result model does not contain any information about the user
     c. inputs and log files are deleted after data are downloaded
   B. Mode 2: nothing saved.  Inputs results deleted from server 
        after data are downloaded

   Server can only carry out pre-specified commands (i.e., model prediction),
   and only allows json text to be uploaded.

   Data is accessible to the Phenix developers while running.
   The developers will only access this data to debug the system.


The output predicted model
--------------------------

The predicted model produced by AlphaFold with Phenix will consist of a single 
chain with exactly the sequence that is supplied. It will be in the
standard PDB (version 3.2) format.  It will contain all (non-hydrogen)
atoms for all the residues.  The coordinates of the atoms have the usual meaning
(locations of atoms in 3D space), but the orientation and position of the chain
are arbitrary.  The B-value field (normally atomic displacement parameters) will
contain the values of pLDDT (confidence), with one value per residue.  This means
that some processing of this model is necessary before use (this is normally done by
`phenix.process_predicted_model <process_predicted_model.html>`_).

The pLDDT confidence measure
----------------------------

AlphaFold provides residue-level estimates of model accuracy in the form of
predicted values of the LDDT (Local Difference Distance Test, Mariani et al., 2013).
These predicted
values are referred to as pLDDT values (predicted Local Difference Distance Test).
The LDDT measure is a number from zero to one that reflects the similarity of
CA positions in two structures.

The LDDT is not a simple measure of accuracy, but rather a composite that is based on
the CA distances between all pairs of CA atoms in one model and how similar these
inter-atomic distances are to those in the other model. It is a local test, where
only inter-atomic distances that are less than 15 Å are considered.

The LDDT is a composite that is generated from
the fraction of CA-CA distances that are very accurate (less than 0.5 Å off), the fraction
that are quite accurate (less than 1 Å off), moderately accurate (less than 2 Å off),
and somewhat accurate (less than 4 Å off).  If all CA-CA distances are within 0.5 Å,
the resulting score will be 1, if all are more than 4 Å off, the score is zero.  
Note that the LDDT is related to RMSD, but not in a simple way.

The pLDDT values (predicted Local Difference Distance Test) provided by AlphaFold are
estimates of the LDDT values.  The pLDDT values are essentially unbiased (just as likely
to be too low as too high), and reasonably accurate. The correlation between pLDDT values
and actual LDDT values calculated using AlphaFold models and models in the PDB 
is about 0.7 - 0.75, which means that the values of pLDDT you get are useful indicators
of model quality but also that sometimes AlphaFold will have high confidence in 
an incorrect prediction or low confidence in a correct prediction.

As the pLDDT metric is an estimate of local error, it does not tell you that much about
long-range distortions or domain movements between the predicted and actual
structure.  The PAE matrix does have some information about these features because
it is not restricted to short distances.


The output MSA file
-------------------

The MSA file that was used in AlphaFold prediction is available if the Phenix
server is used. This MSA file can be used in subsequent predictions (if the sequence
is identical).  Normally there is no need to supply an MSA file because the MSA
is saved by the Phenix server and it will just be re-used if the same sequence is
supplied.  However if you want to edit this MSA file before running an AlphaFold
prediction, you can do that.

The output PAE file
-------------------

AlphaFold provides a Predicted Aligned Error matrix in the form of a PAE file. 
The error that it is describing reflects the estimated error in CA positions
in the predicted model compared to the (unknown) true structure.  

Suppose we had both the prediction and the true structure.  Then suppose we
superpose the predicted model on the true structure, basing the superposition
on the residues near residue i.  Using that superposition, we can now look
at the location of the CA atom of residue j in the predicted model and in
the true structure.  We could in particular note the distance between the
predicted and actual position of the CA atom of residue j, when the structures
are superposed using residues near residue i.  We could do this for every
residue pair (i,j), and the result would be the Aligned Error matrix.

The Predicted Aligned Error matrix is an estimate of the Aligned Error matrix
It is generated by AlphaFold. Basically, AlphaFold predicts the model and
also it generates an error estimate in the prediction.

The PAE matrix is useful for identifying domains within a predicted chain that
are accurately predicted, along with connecting regions that are more
uncertain.  In the Phenix GUI the PAE matrix is plotted with dark green indicating
low PAE values (relationships between pairs of residues that are predicted
to be accurate).  A domain that is accurately predicted can be seen in 
such a plot as a solid green square along the diagonal.  If your plot has
just one big green square, it is probably all quite accurate. If it looks
instead like a few squares along the diagonal, probably the individual 
domains are accurately predicted, but their relationship is not known.

Relationship between the pLDDT values and the PAE matrix
--------------------------------------------------------

The PAE matrix is related to the pLDDT values, but not in a simple way.

The pLDDT value for a residue
describes the expected errors in the distances between that CA atom 
and nearby CA atoms (compared to the true structure) on a scale of 0 to
1, where 1 means all CA-CA distances are expected to match within 0.5 Å.

The value of the PAE matrix for a pair of residues 
is the estimated error in Å in the position of the CA atom for the second
residue if the model is superposed on the true structure using CA atoms
near the first CA atom.

Both measures tell you something about the uncertainties in your model,
but neither tells you exactly how well the model would superpose on the
true structure.

Rough guide as to expected RMSD for a residue if you have the pLDDT
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Here is a table that gives you an idea of the RMSD of CA atoms in an AlphaFold
prediction to a superposed deposited model (see Terwilliger et al., 2023):

::

    pLDDT         Median prediction error     % with error over 2 Å
  
  pLDDT > 90               0.6 Å                    10%
  pLDDT > 80-90            1.1 Å                    22%
  pLDDT > 70-80            1.5 Å                    33%
  pLDDT < 70               3.5 Å                    77%

This table shows that high-confidence residues (pLDDT >90) are generally 
incredibly accurate, but a few (10%) still are off by more than 2 Å. 
Low-confidence residues (pLDDT < 70) are usually pretty far off 
(median of 3.5 Å) but still almost a quarter are better than 2 Å.


Examples
--------

Standard run of predict_model
---------------------------------

Running predict_model is easy. From the command-line you can type:

::

    phenix.predict_and_build jobname=myjob seq_file=seq.dat \
      prediction_server=PhenixServer \
      stop_after_predict=True


Common questions
----------------

How long will it take?
----------------------

A typical protein chain with 200 residues will take about 5-10 minutes to run,
once it has started on the Phenix server.

Timing is more or less proportional to chain length.  If you specify that
more than 5 models are to be built, it will typically take longer.

If your chain has already been predicted for you or for someone else, you
normally should get a result (a copy of that prediction) in about 30 seconds
or less.

If the Phenix server is full (typically 6 jobs can run at once), you can use
the Server button on the Phenix GUI to see the expected wait time to
start a job.

Server problems
---------------

The most common problem in running Predict model is that the Phenix
server is not working as expected.  Normally the first thing
to try is just let the program retry (it will do this for a while normally).
If that does not work, you can take the files in the packaged
.tgz file (listed in the GUI output), use them to get your own prediction with
any server, and put the resulting predicted models in the place specified in 
the GUI or program output.
