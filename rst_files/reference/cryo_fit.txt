Abstract
-------------------
With many crystallography groups shifting to cryogenic electron
microscopy (cryo-EM), there is a high demand for software that can
produce atomistic models for high resolution cryo-EM
datasets. Therefore, we are incorporating our automated cryo-EM
density fitting method (cryo_fit) into a widely used software suite
for macromolecular structure determination (PHENIX). Cryo_fit produces
all-atom models highly consistent with the EM density and is being
used to construct models for many functional complexes (including one
of the first all-atom models of the human ribosome, revealing a new
conformational change specific to eukaryotic ribosomes: subunit
rolling). Two key advantages of the cryo_fit are its speed and the
preservation of stereochemistry information. Its fast speed allows
cryo-EM scientists to run on a single laptop (several hours for a
ribosome modeling without the need for GPU) instead of thousands of
cores. It uses a reduced model molecular dynamics potential that allows us to preserve
stereochemistry information. As an additional advantage, secondary and
tertiary contact potentials can be specified to place additional
restraints on contacts within a cutoff keeping them intact during the
fitting process.
