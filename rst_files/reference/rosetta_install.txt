General installation instructions for Rosetta for use in Phenix
===============================================================

.. contents::

General notes
-------------

Rosetta is used by a number of modules in Phenix including
rosetta\_refine, ERRASER and MR\_rosetta. Installing Rosetta for
rosetta\_refine involves compiling some more programs for the interface
between Phenix and Rosetta. The other programs will run with a binary
installation of Rosetta or the compiled installation of Rosetta. From a
practical point-of-view, making the effort to install the compiled
version of Rosetta means that you can run all three programs.

To run any Rosetta programs, you need to install Rosetta from the Baker
laboratory at the University of Washington.
Once you have installed Rosetta you
need to set the environmental variable $PHENIX\_ROSETTA\_PATH.

.. $ROSETTA\_BIN and $ROSETTA3\_DB.

You will need the 2016.02.58402 bundle or later so Rosetta version 3.6 is a
fine choice. It is quicker to download the source
bundle and the binaries are not required when installing for ALL programs.

NOTE: If trouble...see the FULL INSTRUCTIONS at https://www.rosettacommons.org/support

Proceed with the following.

-  go to `https://c4c.uwc4c.com/express\_license\_technologies/rosetta <https://c4c.uwc4c.com/express_license_technologies/rosetta>`__,
   find "Academic License" and click on "LICENSE". Fill out the form,
   and receive by email a link to the download site and a
   login/password.
-  Go to the latest download (for example Rosetta 2016.40)
   on the download site, select Download, and download Rosetta "as one bundle".
-  Unpack and install Rosetta: Go to the directory where you want to
   install it and move the downloaded file (something like
   rosetta\_src\_2016.02.58402\_bundle.tgz)
   there. Then...changing the names to match your bundle...

::

    tar xzf rosetta_src_2016.02.58402_bundle.tgz

This should give you a directory like rosetta\_src\_2016.02.58402\_bundle that contains:

    demos   main    tools

.. Now you want to compile. You must have python on your machine...if
   not you will need to install it from http://www.python.org/. You will
   also need scons. If you don't have scons you can get it from
   www.scons.org/. NOTE: you will need version 2.2 or later of python
   and 0.96.1 of scons. You can check your versions with:

..    python --version
      scons --version

-  NOTE: on Ubuntu you may also need zlib1g-dev. You can get this
   library and scons with:

::

        sudo su   # UBUNTU ONLY FOR INSTALLING zlib1g and scons
        apt-get install zlib1g-dev
        apt-get install scons

Notice where you have installed rosetta. The directory you just set
up, now containing "main" is to be called "PHENIX\_ROSETTA\_PATH".
Now you can now set a local environmental variable in your ".profile"
(sh or bash shell) or ".cshrc" (c-shell) to mark where rosetta is
located: if you are using the bash or sh shells:

::

    export PHENIX_ROSETTA_PATH=/your-path-to-rosetta-here/

..  export ROSETTA_BIN=$PHENIX_ROSETTA_PATH/main/source/bin
    export ROSETTA3_DB=$PHENIX_ROSETTA_PATH/main/database

or sh (C-shell):

::

    setenv PHENIX_ROSETTA_PATH /your-path-to-rosetta-here/

..  setenv ROSETTA_BIN $PHENIX_ROSETTA_PATH/main/source/bin
    setenv ROSETTA3_DB $PHENIX_ROSETTA_PATH/main/database

The final step is to build the interface for rosetta\_refine. This is a
similar step to the previous scons step so supply as many nproc as
available on your machine.

::
  
  rosetta.build_phenix_interface nproc=2

Specific notes
--------------

To use the fragment server and your machine is behind a firewall and
there is a proxy server you need to go through, then if you use a .hhr
file to download files from the PDB then you will need to specify your
proxy server. You can use the following command to specify the proxy
server (replacing it with YOUR proxy server).

If you are using the bash or sh shells:

::

    export HTTP_PROXY=proxyout.mydomain.edu:8080

or sh (C-shell):

::

    setenv HTTP_PROXY proxyout.mydomain.edu:8080

-  Now you are completely ready to go with Rosetta in Phenix

NOTE: If trouble on ubuntu 11.04 or later...also see:
http://morganbye.net/blog/2011/05/rosetta-32-ubuntu-1104 (but just
concerning basic.settings and options.settings modifications and using :
scons bin mode=release cxx=gcc cxx\_ver=4.5)
