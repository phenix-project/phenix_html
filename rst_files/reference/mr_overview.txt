Overview of molecular replacement in Phenix
===========================================

.. contents::

Molecular replacement (MR) is a phasing method that uses prior information in
the form of known structures that are related or homologous to components in
the crystal. Because it requires no additional experimental procedures or data,
and additionally simplifies model-building, MR is usually the method of choice
for structure determination when a suitable search model is available.

For new users, we recommend reading this document first, followed by the
`Phaser-MR tutorial <../tutorials/mr.html>`_ for a step-by-step introduction to
running MR in the `Phenix GUI`_.

Steps in structure solution with molecular replacement
------------------------------------------------------

Model selection
==================

   Structures of suitable models are normally found via homology searches
   (using e.g. `NCBI Blast`_ for reasonably close relatives or
   `HHpred`_ for more distant relatives), and can be characterized by the 
   sequence identity with the target sequence.

   The main restriction on the use of molecular replacement is the requirement
   for a suitably similar search model.  Although there is no exact rule for this,
   the relationship between sequence identity and MR success is roughly as
   follows:

    - **Better than 40% identity**: usually easy, unless large conformational
      changes are involved.

    - **30-40%**: MR usually possible, but sometimes more difficult.

    - **20-30%**: MR usually difficult if at all possible, careful model search
      and preparation required.

    - **Less than 20%**: MR unlikely to work, but MR-Rosetta_ can help in 
      marginal cases.

    - In terms of RMSD, above 2.5A is very unlikely to work, while 1.5A or less
      is preferable.

   Structures that undergo large conformational changes may need to be split
   into separate domains for searching, regardless of sequence identity.  Where
   multiple similar search models are available, combining these into an ensemble
   will often improve the likelihood of success, particularly if the trimming
   option in Ensembler_ is used to trim the ensemble back to its conserved core.

   In Phenix, the Sculptor_ and Ensembler_ utilities are available for preparing
   search models. Sculptor_ can be used to improve the model by pruning residues
   and side chains according to an alignment between the model structure and the
   target sequence, and also to apply B-factor weights to the model to weight
   down unreliable parts. Ensembler_ can be used to superpose homologous models
   automatically. The recommended order is to run Sculptor_ and then Ensembler_,
   for reasons explained in the `MR FAQ <../faqs/mr.html#sculptor-ensembler-order>`__.

Molecular replacement
========================

   The procedure to place a search model is roughly divided into two
   steps, a **rotation function** (RF) to determine its orientation, and a
   **translation function** (TF) to determine its absolute position in the unit
   cell.  Multiple components can be placed sequentially to solve the structure of
   a complex or the structure of a crystal containing multiple copies in the
   asymmetric unit.

   In Phenix, MR is performed by the program Phaser_, written by
   Randy Read's group at the University of Cambridge.  Although Phaser_ may be run
   on the command line with CCP4-style inputs, we recommend using the `Phaser-MR
   GUI <phaser_mr.html>`_.  This GUI requires manual preparation and specification
   of search models, but enables fine control over parameters and multi-step
   searches, which may be necessary for difficult structures. See the
   `Phaser-MR GUI`_ manual for additional details specific to that interface.

   (Phaser is also used for experimental phasing, but this functionality is
   exposed through the `AutoSol wizard`_ and `Phaser-EP GUI`_.)

Input files and mandatory parameters
------------------------------------

All of the MR programs in Phenix require a single reflections file containing
experimental data (with sigmas); the `Phaser-MR GUI`_ will accept any file format
or data type, including intensities.  The procedure traditionally uses all
reflections, so R-free flags are not required.  (Unlike refinement, this does
not significantly bias the final R-free value, since there are so few degrees of
freedom: six to rotate and translate each molecule, and one each for the overall 
B-factor and estimated RMS error.)

At least one search model is required; in the context of Phaser_ the search
model is usually referred to as an "ensemble".  In many cases this will be a
single PDB file containing one structure. For more distant models, an actual
ensemble model may be used instead - either a PDB file with multiple MODEL
records, or multiple similar PDB files.  When using a multi-model ensemble, all
models must be superposed in the same orientation; the Ensembler_ utility is
used for this. There are no limitations on the size, complexity, or number of
search models.  For complexes or multimers, if the relative positions of
individual subunits do not change, the entire assembly (for instance, a
ribosomal subunit) may be used as a search model instead of placing each
component separately.

Another option is to search using electron density (or rather, an MTZ file
containing pre-weighted map coefficients), often solved at low resolution
or obtained from cryoEM image reconstruction.
This requires additional information about the center and extent of the map
section to search with. It is best to prepare this MTZ file using the
phenix.cut_out_density_ tool, making sure that the density is placed in a unit
cell that is at least 2.5 times the x, y and z extents of the density.

The maximum likelihood phasing methods used in Phaser_ require prior knowledge
about the deviation (or variance) of the search model(s) from the real
structure, and the expected composition or scattering mass of the crystal.  To
specify the model variance, either an RMSD value or percent sequence identity
may be used (these will be converted internally, using relationships determined
from a database of test calculations).  It is important to minimize the
variance if possible (see `Model selection`_ for guidelines), which often
requires eliminating atoms or modifying B-factors.  The Sculptor_ utility will
perform this step, given a PDB file and a sequence alignment.  (This is usually
unnecessary for search models with high sequence identity to the target molecule,
however, especially at lower sequence identity, processing models with the
Sculptor_ utility is highly recommended.) Additionally, the Ensembler_ utility
can trim loops that deviate among members of the ensemble, leaving only the
conserved core.

For composition, you may supply a sequence file (protein or nucleic acid), or
simply enter the molecular weight.  The standalone versions of Phaser_ also
accept the fractional composition of each search ensemble, if known.  Note that
the composition data does not necessarily have a 1:1 correspondence with the
search ensembles (see `MR FAQ <../faqs/mr.html#composition-search-ensemble-relation>`__
for details); if you wish to simply specify the molecular weight of a complex
while searching for multiple subunits, you may enter the mass for the complex
as a single component.  (You may also use multi-record FASTA-format sequence
files.)  Even if you are only searching for a single ensemble out of several
(e.g. the protein in a protein-DNA complex), you must still supply the expected
composition of the entire crystal because Phaser needs to know what fraction of
the asymmetric unit each search model comprises.

Outline of MR procedure
-----------------------

The automated molecular replacement method in Phaser_ involves several discrete
steps:

  - **Anisotropy correction**: scales reflections as necessary to overcome
    anisotropy (weak data in a particular direction).

  - **Translational non-crystallographic symmetry (tNCS) correction**: checks
    for the presence of tNCS.  If present, parameters describing the
    translation and small orientation differences between copies are
    determined and used to compute correction factors.

  - **Rotation function**: identifies possible orientations of the model.

  - **Translation function**: given the orientation(s) from the RF, finds the
    absolute position(s) in the unit cell.

  - **Packing analysis**: filters TF results based on number of clashes
    between atoms, given a certain cutoff.

  - **Refinement and phasing**: performs simple rigid-body refinement of the
    placed molecules, and calculates phases from the final solution.

  - **Log-likelihood gain calculation**: determines the final LLG, which can
    be used to evaluate the success of MR.

If multiple search models are used, these steps will be performed sequentially
for each model.  Although each step may be run individually in the `Phaser-MR
GUI`_, this is necessary only in exceptionally difficult cases.  In fact, it
is usually better to allow Phaser_ to work out an optimal search order and,
if necessary, test different choices of search order.

Limitations
-----------

You should watch out for otherwise valid solutions being thrown out because of
packing clashes due to model deviations and/or extra residues.  Phaser will
attempt to resolve clashes by pruning segments of chain that refine to low
occupancy values. If this does not succeed, manually removing the
offending residues or lowering the packing cutoff can circumvent the problem.

For cases where anomalous data from a SAD experiment are available, a poor (but
genuine) MR solution may be used to identify heavy-atom sites and combined with
SAD phases, a technique known as MR-SAD.  This may provide a decent-quality map
where neither technique is independently sufficient.  At the end of MR in the
`Phaser-MR GUI`_, if SAD data are available a button will be presented
allowing MR-SAD in the `AutoSol wizard`_ to be launched easily.

The MRage_ framework integrates model processing steps and molecular replacement
into one application. It provides a highly customizable interface with
parallelization options and the ability to connect to the `NCBI Blast`_ and
wwPDB_ websites to perform homology searches and fetch potential models. A
