Purpose
-------

superpose\_pdbs is a command line tool for superimposing one PDB model
on another and writing out the superimposed model.

Usage
-----

How superpose\_pdbs works:
--------------------------

superpose\_pdbs performes a least-squares superposition of two selected
parts from two pdb files. If no selections is provided for fixed and
moving models the whole content of both input PDB files is used for
superposition. If the number of atoms in fixed and moving models is
different and the models contain amino-acid residues then the sequence
alignment is performed and the matching residues (CA atoms by default,
can be changed by the user) are used for superposition. Note that
selected (and/or matching) atoms are the atoms used to find the
superposition operators while these operators are applied to the whole
moving structure.

*Output files from superpose\_pdbs*
-----------------------------------

A PDB file with fitted model.

Examples
--------

Standard run of superpose\_pdbs:
--------------------------------

Running the superpose\_pdbs is easy. From the command-line you can type:

::

    phenix.superpose_pdbs fixed.pdb moving.pdb

Parameters can be changed from the command line:

::

    phenix.superpose_pdbs fixed.pdb moving.pdb selection_fixed="chain A and name CA" selection_moving="chain B and name CA"

Possible Problems
-----------------

Specific limitations and problems:
----------------------------------

-  Different number of atoms in selection\_fixed and selection\_moving
   in case when no sequence alignment can be performed (the molecules
   contain no amino-acid residues) or sequence alignment failed to find
   matching residues.

-  More than one model in one PDB file (separated with MODEL-ENDMDL)
