Calculating a simple NCS averaged map
=====================================

If you already have map coefficients in an MTZ file and have identified
your NCS with ``phenix.find_ncs`` and just want to calculate the average
density in all your NCS copies, you can use ``phenix.ncs_average``. In
most cases this can be run automatically by passing the name of the MTZ
file and the ncs\_spec file with NCS information.

The output of ``phenix.ncs_average`` is a CCP4-style map file.

These simple NCS averaged maps can be accurate maps for cases with high
NCS symmetry and they are useful for evaluating what an NCS density
modified map should be expected to look like.

If you want to see the region that is being averaged, you can run 
``phenix.ncs_average`` like this (notice the double and single quotes, 
both are necessary):

`` phenix.ncs_average  ncs_map_coeffs.mtz ncs.ncs_spec resolve_command_list=" 'ncs_mask_file ncs_mask.ccp4' "``

If you want to specify the region to be averaged, you can do this by supplying
a PDB file and the mask will be around atoms in that file:

`` phenix.ncs_average ncs_map_coeffs.mtz ncs.ncs_spec resolve_command_list=" 'ncs_mask_file ncs_mask.ccp4' 'model model_defining_mask.pdb' 'use_model_mask' 'rad_mask 5 ' " ``
