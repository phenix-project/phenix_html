Purpose
-------

Remove parts of a model that overlap with another model.  Useful if you have
a good model for part of the your structure and you want to add in only the new
parts from another model. This can be the case if you have a good 
AlphaFold2 model for most of your structure and a possibly overlapping model
from another source.

How trim_overlapping works:
---------------------------

The trim_overlapping tool identifies all the residues in your model that have
a CA (or P for nucleic acids) atom close to one in the model to avoid. The
cutoff distance is typically 3 A for proteins and is adjustable.  If the 
remaining residues lead to short segments, those segments are removed too. The
shortest segment to keep is also adjustable.

Examples
--------

Standard run of trim_overlapping:
---------------------------------

Running trim_overlapping is easy. From the command-line you can type:

::

    phenix.trim_overlapping my_model.pdb model_to_avoid.pdb

This will trim my_model.pdb to avoid model_to_avoid and write out
my_model_trimmed.pdb
