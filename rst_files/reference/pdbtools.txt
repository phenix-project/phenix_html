Manipulations on a model in a PDB file including
------------------------------------------------

The operations below can be applied to the whole model or selected parts
(e.g. "selection=chain A and backbone"). See examples below.

- shaking of coordinates (random coordinate shifts)
- rotation-translation shift of coordinates
- shaking of occupancies
- set occupancies to a value
- shaking of ADP (B-factors)
- shifting of ADP (addition of a constant value)
- scaling of ADP (multiplication by a constant value)
- setting ADP to a given value
- conversion to isotropic or anisotropic ADP
- removal of selected parts of a model
- renumbering of residues
- truncation to poly-ALA
- convert SeMet residues to Met
- adjust segid field in PDB format

Graphical interface
-------------------

As input, only a PDB file and appropriate geometry restraints (in
`CIF format <file_formats.html#cif>`_ are required.  (The geometry restraints
are actually optional if you uncheck the box "Stop for unknown residues", but
they are strongly recommended.)  Crystal symmetry is not essential but also
recommended, and will be propagated to the output model.

Many different options are possible, only some of which are shown in the
main window.  The atom selection controls can be used to specify which part
of the model will be affected by various changes, or to eliminate parts of
the model.  The operations on coordinates, B-factors, and occupancies also
have separate (optional) atom selections.

(Note: in past versions PDBTools was also responsible for geometry minimization
and addition of hydrogen atoms using Reduce; these methods have been moved to
the programs phenix.geometry_minimization and phenix.ready_set, respectively.)

Command-line use
----------------

In the absence of a CRYST1 record in the PDB file, functionality
that doesn't require knowledge of the crystal symmetry is still
available. To enable the full functionality, the crystal symmetry
can be specified externally (e.g. via the --symmetry option).

Some specific examples:

**1)** Type ``phenix.pdbtools`` from the command line for instructions::

  % phenix.pdbtools

**2)** To see all default parameters::

  % phenix.pdbtools --show-defaults=all

**3)** Suppose a PDB model consist of three chains A, B and C and some water
molecules. Remove all atoms in chain C and all waters::

  % phenix.pdbtools model.pdb remove="chain C or water"

or one can achieve exactly the same result with equivalent command::

  % phenix.pdbtools model.pdb keep="chain A or chain B"

or::

  % phenix.pdbtools model.pdb keep="not(chain C or water)"

or finally::

  % phenix.pdbtools model.pdb remove="not(chain A or chain B)"

The result of all four equivalent commands above will be a new PDB file
containing chains A and B only. Important: the commands ``keep`` and
``remove`` cannot be used simultaneously.

**4)** Remove all but backbone atoms and set all b-factors to 25::

  % phenix.pdbtools model.pdb keep=backbone set_b_iso=25

**5)** Suppose a PDB model consist of three chains A, B and C and some water
molecules. Remove all but backbone atoms and set b-factors to 25 for chain C
atoms::

  % phenix.pdbtools model.pdb keep=backbone set_b_iso=25 selection="chain C"

**6)** Show cmprehensive model statistics::

  % phenix.pdbtools model.pdb model_statistics=true
