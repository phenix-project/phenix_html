phenix.sceds: SCEDS - identify domains with normal mode analysis
=====================================================================================================================================

**Description**

SCEDS is useful for identifying domains in a model to be used by molecular replacement when it is
anticipated that there may be conformational motion of one or more domains relative to the domains
in the target structure. Typically in such cases MR underperforms as it is not possible to
match both domains onto the target structure. By partitioning a multidomain structure into distinct
domains it is then possible to do MR searches with each separate domain and achieve a clearer solution than
would otherwise have been possible.
Domains are identified with a normal mode analysis. See literature reference
below.

To use SCEDS supply it with the MR model and execute it. Depending on the size of the model it may
take some time before it completes.

Output is one or more domains each saved into separate pdb files. These can then be used in
molecular replacement. It is good practice to inspect the identified domains in a graphical viewer
such as Coot or Pymol.

The structure with PDB id 1XHB before running SCEDS. Two distinct domains can be discerned
in the structure.


.. image:: ../images/SCEDS3.png

After running SCEDS the two domains have been identified and saved into separate pdb files.
