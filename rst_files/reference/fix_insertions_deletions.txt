Purpose
-------

The routine fix_insertions_deletions is a tool for fixing register errors
in a model by comparing the density at side-chain positions to a
sequence file.

Usage
-----

How fix_insertions_deletions works:
-----------------------------------

The fix_insertions_deletions tool examines the density in the supplied map 
at the position of each side chain in the supplied model and creates a table
of side-chain probabilities corresponding to each segment in the model.

These side-chain probabilities are used to generate a map-based sequence for
the model and map.  This map-based sequence is then compared to the actual
sequence to identify positions where the sequence register is likely to
be incorrect, and what changes in register are needed to fix it.

Each place a register shift is needed is used as a target for main-chain
rebuilding.  During rebuilding the specified insertion or deletion is
enforced so that only models with the desired changes are obtained (if
possible).

Additional rebuilding of the worst-fitting regions is also carried out.


Using fix_insertions_deletions: 
-------------------------------

The tool fix_insertions_deletions is usually run automatically as part of
trace_and_build. However you can run it yourself to try and fix up a model.

Input map file: The map file should cover the model you supply.

Resolution:  Specify the resolution of your map (usually the
resolution defined by your half-dataset Fourier shell correlation

Model:  Supply a model that you want to fix. Only the main-chain will matter.

Sequence:  Supply a sequence file that covers at least the part of the 
model that is supplied

Examples

Standard run of fix_insertions_deletions:
-----------------------------------------

You can use fix_insertions_deletions to fix register shifts in 
a  model based on a cryo-EM map:
