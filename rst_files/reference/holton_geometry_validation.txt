Purpose
-------

Summarize geometric quality of a model

How holton_geometry_validation works:
-------------------------------------

This tool summarizes the geometric quality of a model by calculating
pseudo-energies (square of the value of the deviation from ideality 
divided by sigma) for every aspect of a model (each bond length, angle, 
rotamer, Ramachandran value, etc). For each metric (such as angles),
the mean energy and worst energy are noted, and 
the probabilities of this mean and this worst value not occurring by chance
are estimated.
To reduce the dominance of very poor values, energy values E
over 10 are filtered by reducing them toward 10 with a logarithmic function.
The weighted energy for each metric is sum of the mean energy and
the filtered worst energy for that metric, each weighted by their 
probabilities of not occurring by chance.

The overall energy is the sum of weighted energies for all metrics.  The
metrics used are: 

::

  CBetadev: Deviation of CB position from ideal (A)
  Clash:    Clash of non-bonded atoms (A)
  Omega:    Peptide omega angle deviation (degrees)
  Rama:     Ramachandran outlier probability
  Rota:     Rotamer outlier probability
  Angle:    Angle deviation (degrees)
  Bond:     Bond length deviation (A)
  Chir:     Chirality deviation (A**3)
  Torsion:  Torsion angle deviation (degrees)
  Full-nonbond: Non-bonded deviations, including all instances
  Nonbond:  Non-bonded deviations (using Lennard-Jones potential, 
            excluding bonds that are plausible and have low energies)
  Plane:    Planarity deviations (A)


Estimate of expected energy for ideal structure
-----------------------------------------------

This tool estimates the expected energy for a structure that has all 
bonds, angles, etc, distributed as normal distributions with the sigmas
used in the geometry validation step above.  That is, if the structure
had a normal distribution of errors, it would have about this energy. The
energy is estimated by sampling from a normal distribution when calculating
the energy terms instead of taking the actual deviations.  The sampling 
process is carried out many times (20) and the averages are reported.

Estimate of ratio of deviations to sigmas
-----------------------------------------

The tool estimates the overall ratio of deviations to sigmas in three steps 

First it lists all the values deviation/sigma for all the metrics. If the
deviations were drawn from random Gaussian distributions with standard 
deviations of their corresponding sigmas, these values of deviation/sigma
would be normally distributed with a standard deviation of one.

Then the 99.7th percentile of values of deviation/sigma is noted.  
For a Gaussian distribution, this percentile corresponds to 3 standard 
deviations. The estimated ratio of deviations/sigma overall is 
then 1/3 of this 99.7th percentile value,
or 1 standard deviation of the ratios of deviation to sigma.

Comparing two models
--------------------

If you want to be quite sure about whether model A.pdb is better than B.pdb,
you can supply both models to holton_geometry_validation (one as model and
the other as other_models). The tool will 
calculate scores for A.pdb and B.pdb using not just the standard parameters,
but all reasonable values of these parameters. The overall
estimate of the difference in scores is obtained by averaging over the 
differences in scores using the sets of varied parameters.  An overall
difference and SD of the difference is supplied.  If A.pdb consistently has
a better score than B.pdb, you can be relatively confident that it really 
is better.

You can supply a list of models as well (or a model and a set of other_models),
and each will be compared to the first model in the list.

Uses
----

You can use holton_geometry_validation to compare models for the same structure
and identify which has fewer overall geometric problems.

You can use the expected energy to see if your structure has errors that
are about what is expected based on ideal model geometry and uncertainties.

You can use the estimate of ratio of deviations to sigmas to further examine
whether the deviations from ideality in your structure are about what is
expected based on the expected variation in geometric values.

Comparing a series of models to see how each compares to the first model.

Examples
--------

Standard run of holton_geometry_validation:
-------------------------------------------

Running holton_geometry_validation is easy. From the command-line you can type:

::

  phenix.holton_geometry_validation 1ss8_A.pdb

where 1ss8_A.pdb is the model you would like to evaluate.

Possible Problems
-----------------

If your structure has hydrogen positions that do not match those expected
by Phenix, you can ignore them in all metrics except non-bonded interactions
with ignore_h_except_in_nonbond=True.  Alternatively you can redo their
positions with keep_hydrogens=False.

If you want to ignore just hydrogen positions in Arginine residues, you can
specify ignore_arg_h_nonbond=True.

If you want to exclude hydrogen nonbond contacts involving waters, use
ignore_water_h_bonds, and if you want to exclude all bonds involving hydrogen,
ignore_bond_lengths_with_h=True
