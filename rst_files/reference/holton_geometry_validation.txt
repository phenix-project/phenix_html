Purpose
-------

Summarize geometric quality of a model

How holton_geometry_validation works:
-------------------------------------

This tool summarizes the geometric quality of a model by calculating
pseudo-energies for every aspect of a model (each bond length, angle, 
rotamer, Ramachandran value, etc). For each metric (such as angles),
the mean value and worst value of the pseudo-energy are calculated, and 
the probabilities of this mean and this worst value not occurring by chance
are estimated.  To reduce the dominance of very poor values, energy values
over 10 are filtered by reducing them toward 10 with a logarithmic function.

The weighted energy for each metric is sum of the mean energy and
the filtered worst energy for that metric, each weighted by their 
probabilities of not occurring by chance.

The overall energy is the sum of weighted energies for all metrics.  The
metrics used are: 

::

  CBetadev: Deviation of CB position from ideal (A)
  Clash:    Clash of non-bonded atoms (A)
  Omega:    Peptide omega angle deviation (degrees)
  Rama:     Ramachandran outlier probability
  Rota:     Rotamer outlier probability
  Angle:    Angle deviation (degrees)
  Bond:     Bond length deviation (A)
  Chir:     Chirality deviation (A**3)
  Torsion:  Torsion angle deviation (degrees)
  Full-nonbond: Non-bonded deviations, including all instances
  Nonbond:  Non-bonded deviations (using Lennard-Jones potential, 
            excluding bonds that are plausible and have low energies)
  Plane:    Planarity deviations (A)



Uses
----

You can use holton_geometry_validation to compare models for the same structure
and identify which has fewer overall geometric problems.

Examples
--------

Standard run of holton_geometry_validation:
-------------------------------------------

Running holton_geometry_validation is easy. From the command-line you can type:

::

  phenix.holton_geometry_validation 1ss8_A.pdb

where 1ss8_A.pdb is the model you would like to evaluate.

Possible Problems
-----------------

If your structure has hydrogen positions that do not match those expected
by Phenix, you can ignore them in all metrics except non-bonded interactions
with ignore_h_except_in_nonbond=True.  Alternatively you can redo their
positions with keep_hydrogens=False.

If you want to ignore just hydrogen positions in Arginine residues, you can
specify ignore_arg_h_nonbond=True.

If you want to exclude hydrogen nonbond contacts involving waters, use
ignore_water_h_bonds, and if you want to exclude all bonds involving hydrogen,
ignore_bond_lengths_with_h=True
