Reducing resolution of cryo-EM maps by adding random noise

Purpose
-------

The reduce_cryoem_resolution tool constructs a realistic set of lower-resolution
maps by adding random noise to the half-maps. Noise is added as a function of
resolution of the Fourier terms so that the resulting half-map FSC curve looks
typical of an experimental map at that resolution.

How reduce_cryoem_resolution works
----------------------------------

A study of hundreds of FSC curves from maps in the EMDB at different resolutions
showed that these FSC curves could be approximated very well with a simple
functional form that depends only on the nominal resolution of the map. To 
reduce the resolution to match the generic curve requires evaluating the signal
to noise ratio from the input half-maps, than adding resolution-dependent random
noise to produce the desired FSC curve. To avoid including any information beyond
the target resolution, the Fourier terms are filtered at the target resolution,
where the half-map FSC is 0.143. The two half-maps and the corresponding averaged
full map are produced, in addition to an optional plot showing half-map FSC curves
for the original and reduced-resolution maps.

Running reduce_cryoem_resolution
--------------------------------

This can be controlled by an input script using the phil syntax, either on the
command line or in a phil file. The command to take two half-maps and limit a 
starting resolution of 3A to 4A, while producing the FSC plot, looks like this:

::

  phenix.reduce_cryoEM_resolution hm1.mrc hm2.mrc d_min=3.0 target_d_min=4.0 plot=True

Note that the starting d_min is optional, but is useful if you want to compare the
maps over their full resolution ranges.

It is recommended to start with half-maps when they are available, but it is also
possible to reduce the resolution of a single full map. Here it is assumed that
the map is close to perfect at the new resolution limit.
