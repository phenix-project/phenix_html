Purpose
-------

The routine refine_ca_model is a tool for adjusting CA/CB positions in a
preliminary model to increase its suitability for generating an all-atom model.

Usage
-----

How refine_ca_model works:
--------------------------

The refine_ca_model tool takes a set of CA positions, and optionally, a
set of CB positions. It adjusts the CA/CB positions to put the atoms in 
density (if possible) and also to place the CB atoms in plausible positions
relative to the CA positions and also to make the CA-CA distances as close
to 3.8 A as possible.


Using refine_ca_model: 
----------------------

The tool refine_ca_model is usually run automatically as part of
trace_and_build. However you can run it yourself with a CA/CB model,
a map, and a resolution.

Input map file: The map file should cover the model you supply.

Resolution:  Specify the resolution of your map (usually the
resolution defined by your half-dataset Fourier shell correlation

CA/CB model:  Supply a model that at least has CA positions. If you supply
CB positions the new CB positions will be restrained towards the ones you
supply.

Examples
--------

Standard run of refine_ca_model:
--------------------------------

You can use refine_ca_model to adjust a CA/CB model based on a cryo-EM map:
