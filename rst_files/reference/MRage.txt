MRage: automated molecular replacement
======================================

**MRage** is generic molecular replacement program that is designed to run
efficiently with a large number of possible models on parallel hardware. It
accepts multiple model definitions that are internally processed with
integrated tools to search models and used for molecular replacement.
Identified solutions can be used to speed up the search even further by
model assembly algorithms and limiting search space.

Input
=====

The composition of the unit cell is specified by inputting components, and
potential models for the corresponding component in a hierarchical way. It is
recommended to specify the sequence of a component, which allows for better
handling of partial models (see `Composition stage`_). A stoichiometry of each
component in the final assembly is also assigned at this stage. The overall
count of assemblies in the unit cell can either be input or determined
automatically from the Matthews coefficient. In case no model is known for a
component, the list of potential models should be left empty.

Models
======

Models for a component can be specified stepwise with the amount of
preprocessing required. The following options are available:

  - **ensemble**. This model is used without modification.

  - **model collection**. These models will be superposed and optionally trimmed
    using ``phenix.ensembler``, but no modification of sequence, sidechains, or
    B-factors will be performed.

  - **template**. This model is run through ``phenix.sculptor`` with a given
    set of active protocols (*default*: use all protocols) to remove unrelated
    chain segments and solvent, trim sidechains and weight the model according
    to structure and homology. An alignment can be specified to be used to
    process the structure; in case this is omitted, ``phenix.muscle`` will be
    used to align the model to the target sequence.

  - **homology**. Homology search results. Hits will be fetched from the wwPDB,
    and preprocessed as a **template**. It is possible to limit the homology
    search to the top N hits.

  - **search**. Performs a BLAST search for homologs and processes the results
    as described above.  Requires component sequence.

These steps are performed on-demand, i.e. if no clear solution could be found
with available **ensembles**, the program processes the next **template**, or
fetches the next **homology** search hit, etc.

Symmetry exploration
====================

Specifies the set of space groups to try in the search. Currently, there are
three options available:

  - **dataset**. The space group as specified on the input or read from the
    mtz-file.

  - **enantiomorph**. The space group has been determined from systematic
    absences. The input space group and its enantiomorph (if exists) will be
    used in the search.

  - **pointgroup**. Only the point group of the data has been established. All
    space groups compatible with the point group will be tried.

Space group exploration is exhaustive and can take several macrocycles to
complete. Space groups with clearly inferior results to others are
incrementally removed from the search until the correct space group is
established.

Search organization
===================

**MRage** employs a sequential search algorithm, in which molecules are found
consecutively. The algorithm consists of several stages, and also allows the
exploration of potential space groups.

Composition stage
-----------------

The composition of each partial structure (located in previous macrocycles) is
compared with the composition of the unit cell. Available models that fit in
the missing composition are selected for search. In case the modelled sequence
for a search model is known, the program can account for the fact that a model
may only be a partial model for a component (e.g. one domain only).

Search stage
------------

Calculations are organized into a search tree that is explored according to
depth-first traversal. For the underlying calculations, available functions
from **phaser** [PHASER]_ are used.

For each partial structure and applicable model, a rotation function is
calculated. This is then followed up by a translation function calculation.
Each translation function peaks are checked for packing clashes, and if
accepted, checked whether are significant, probable solutions or not.
Calculations are performed in the order of peak score (RF/TF), model quality
(sequence identity) or partial structure quality (LLG score). Exploration
continues until a significant solution is found (*quick mode*) or all
possibilities has been exhausted (*full mode*). There is also no thresholding
step for rotation (*rationale*: weak signal in rotation function) and
translation function peaks (*rationale*: packing check fast). As a consequence,
more work is performed, but simultaneously this allows weighting translation
function results with packing overlap, and also avoids pipe stalls, which would
adversely effect scaling in a parallel environment.

In quick mode, if a significant solution is found, conventional search
terminates. However, all models that are alternatives of the model that gave
this clear solution are superposed onto the solution and refined. This allows
the quick evaluation of model quality for a potentially large number of
alternative models. Currently, **SSM** [SSM]_ is used for superposition.

Parallelisation is done at a function level. Calculations are dispatched until
the number of assigned CPUs are filled up. Execution can either take place in
a shared memory environment using threads and processes or using a submission
queue (currently *SGE*, *LSF* and *PBS* are supported). The degree of
parallelisation scales with the complexity of the search, and given unlimited
resources, reduces the runtime to a constant. However, in simple cases (e.g.
a good model that gives a clear rotation and translation peak), no parallel
resources can be used.

Refinement
----------

Peaks above a certain threshold of the best peak and those that are identified
as significant solutions are subjected to refinement. After refinement is
completed, a second thresholding step is performed. Top peaks will be
subjected to post-processing and also carried forward for the next macrocycle.
Significant peaks that are below the threshold (e.g. a correct solution for a
small domain) are also input to the post-processing step, but will not be
propagated to the next cycle.

Post-processing
---------------

Significant solutions are analysed for specific features so that the search
could be improved.

  - **Amalgamation**. Assembly of solutions that come from the same starting
    point. In case the "starting point" is empty, allowed origin shifts are
    added to the search. In case the origin is undefined and the space group
    has floating origin, only the rotation component is extracted.

  - **Rotation peak salvage**. Propagates significant rotation peaks to the
    next stage.

  - **Regular assembly recognition**. Identifies local point group symmetry
    from the solution.

  - **Assembly completion**. In case assembly definitions are available (e.g.
    from **regular assembly completion**), and a partial assembly has been
    located, missing molecules are filled in.

No actual calculation is performed, only the possibilities are noted. In case
the given solution enters the next `Search stage`_ (as determined by
`Composition stage`_), these possibilities will be scored as a priority.

Space group exploration
-----------------------

Search progress in possible space groups is compared. Space groups having
significant solutions or above the threshold (determined by the best score
over all space groups) are propagated to the next macrocycle.

Output
======

The program logs all operations it performs. However, this may be difficult to
follow on the screen, especially when multiple space groups are explored, and
therefore, after each macrocycle, a summary of all searches performed is
printed.

Models generated during the solution process are also saved. This includes
structure files fetched from the PDB, but also alignments and homology
searches performed.

Solutions
---------

If the search finishes, solutions are written out in all likely space groups.
For each space group, the top solution is selected, and all partial solutions
above a threshold relative to the top solution is considered. Solutions that
are fully "contained" in a higher scoring solution (i.e. all models correspond
to a model in the higher scoring solution) are discarded. This way, the top
solution is output even if the composition is overestimated, but at the same
time removing incomplete solutions (e.g. 14 molecules out of the total 15)
that cannot be distinguised based on the final score.

Solutions are written out in an internal compressed format, which is capable
of storing a high number of solutions without onerous storage requirements, and
can be manipulated with provided tools.

Usage
=====

Graphical interface
-------------------

As with the generic Phaser GUI, two interfaces are available for running MRage,
one designed for single-component searches with minimal customization of input
models, and an advanced interface that allows all available features to be used.
These are launched from a single button in the main GUI, which will initially
pop up an information dialog describing the available options.

.. image:: ../images/mrage_info.png

The simple GUI is centered around a single input control allowing any combination
of files to be dragged in:

  - **Reflections (mandatory)**: these can be in any file or data format;
    only amplitudes or intensities are required.

  - **Sequence:** should contain a single polymer sequence, in any format.  This
    is highly recommended, and required if you want to perform an automatic
    homology search.

  - **Template models**: unprocessed PDB files, which will be treated by
    Sculptor as described above.

  - **Homology search**: HHPred or BLAST results.

.. image:: ../images/mrage_simple.png

In the simplest cases, only the data and sequence are required; you should then
select a homology search method in the Options section.  "NCBI BLAST" requires
internet access; "Local BLAST" requires that BLAST is installed and available
on the command line.  At this point you can run the program without further
input.

Other settings:

  - **Max. number of hits to use** controls how many PDB entries from the
    homology search are processed by the pipeline.  Increasing this provides
    greater coverage, but at the cost of significantly longer runtimes.

  - **Resolution cutoff** determines the resolution used for running Phaser;
    this does not need to be changed, but increasing the cutoff will result in
    a faster but less accurate run.

  - **Parallelization method** controls how the jobs are distributed across the
    available computing resources.  ``multiprocessing`` and ``threading`` are
    essentially equivalent (although in practice they may behave slightly
    differently), and run locally.  The other options require that you have
    access to one of the supported queuing systems and can submit jobs from the
    computer where you are running the GUI.

  - **Number of CPUs** controls how many jobs are run at once.  It should not
    exceed the number of processors available, either on the local system or the
    queuing system.  (Note: if you plan to use your computer for other tasks
    while MRage is running, you may wish to leave one CPU core free if possible.)

  - **Search mode:** sets the thoroughness of the search, as describe in the
    `Search stage`_ section.

  - **Symmetry exploration** determines the space groups to try (`Symmetry
    exploration`_)

  - **Overall count** is the number of copies of the component to search for in
    the asymmetric unit.

Advanced GUI
------------

This version of the GUI moves the description of the crystal contents and search
information to a separate tab, with input options grouped by component.  The
first tab is essentially similar to the simple GUI, but the only input field is
for the reflections file.

.. image:: ../images/mrage_advanced.png

The composition tab contains another set of tabs for each unique component.
These allow the full range of input files to be specified; some of these have
additional parameters (such as the mandatory sequence identity for ensembles and
model collections).  The "Basic info" tab allows the NCBI BLAST search to be run
interactively if desired (the results will be loaded as a homology result).
A link to the HHPred server, which does not allow automated queries, is
available on the "Homology searches" tab.

.. image:: ../images/mrage_component.png

You must specify the component stoichiometry, i.e. the number of copies of the
component in the overall assembly.  This is distinct from the "Overall count"
parameter in the main tab: for instance, if you are trying to solve a structure
of a hexamer bound to a monomer and expect two copies of the complex in the
asymmetric unit of the crystal, the overall count is two, and the stoichiometry
of the components is 6 and 1 for the hexamer and monomer respectively.

Command line
------------

``phaser.MRage [command-line switches] [PHIL-format parameter files]``

Command-line switches::

  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --show-defaults       print PHIL and exit
  -i, --stdin           read PHIL from stdin as well
  -v, --verbosity       set verbosity level (DEBUG,INFO,WARNING,VERBOSE)

PHIL arguments

Everything not starting with a dash('-') is interpreted as a PHIL argument.
This can be a PHIL-format file containing parameters or a command-line
assignment.
