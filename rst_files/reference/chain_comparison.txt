Purpose
-------

Identify how many of the CA atoms in one model match CA atoms in another 
model. Separately identify how many of these go in the same direction and
how many of the residue names match.

Usage
-----

How chain\_comparison works:
----------------------------

chain\_comparison runs normally selects the unique part of the target model
(the first model specified), then it takes the entire query model and counts 
how many residues in the target model are matched by a residue in the
query model.  If NCS is supplied, the unique part of the query is selected,
NCS is applied and then the same analysis is carried out.

If desired, you can have chain\_comparison write out all the residues in
the query model that are matching residues in the target model.

Examples
--------

Standard run of chain\_comparison:
----------------------------------

Running chain\_comparison is easy. From the command-line you can type:

::

    phenix.chain_comparison target.pdb query.pdb

If you want to compare P positions for RNA/DNA instead, you can say:

::

    phenix.chain_comparison target.pdb query.pdb chain_type=RNA
