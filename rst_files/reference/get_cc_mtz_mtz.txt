Purpose
-------

get\_cc\_mtz\_mtz is a command line tool for adjusting the origin of a
map so that the map superimposes on another map, and obtaining the
correlation of the two maps. The maps are calculated from map
coefficients supplied by the user in two mtz files.

Usage
-----

How get\_cc\_mtz\_mtz works:
----------------------------

get\_cc\_mtz\_mtz calculates maps based on the supplied mtz files, then
uses RESOLVE to find the origin shift compatible with space-group
symmetry that maximizes the correlation of the two maps. This shift is
applied to the second map and the correlation of the maps is calculated.

Several parameters can be set by the user to define how the correlations
are calculated. By default, maps are calculated using all the
reflections present (to the specified high-resolution limit, if any) in
each mtz file.

If you specify

::

    use_only_refl_present_in_mtz_1=True

Then the map calculated using your second mtz file will only include
reflections that were present in your first mtz file. This removes the
effects of missing reflections on the correlation.

If you specify

::

    scale=True

then get\_cc\_mtz\_mtz scales the amplitudes from the second input mtz
file to those in the first input mtz, including an overall B factor and
a scale factor. This reduces effects of differences in overall B factors
between the two mtz files on the correlation.

If you specify

::

    keep_f_mag=False

then get\_cc\_mtz\_mtz uses amplitudes from the first input mtz file and
phases and figure of merit from both to do the correlation. This has the
effect of removing effects due to differences in amplitudes on the
correlation, and focusing on differences in phases and figures of merit.

Examples
--------

Standard run of get\_cc\_mtz\_mtz:
----------------------------------

Running the get\_cc\_mtz\_mtz is easy. From the command-line you can
type:

::

    phenix.get_cc_mtz_mtz map_coeffs_1.mtz  map_coeffs_2.mtz

If you want (or need) to specify the column names from your mtz file,
you will need to tell get\_cc\_mtz\_mtz what FP and PHIB (and optionally
FOM) are, in this format:

::

    phenix.get_cc_mtz_mtz map_coeffs_1.mtz  map_coeffs_2.mtz \
    labin_1="FP=2FOFCWT PHIB=PH2FOFCWT"  labin_2="FP=2FOFCWT PHIB=PH2FOFCWT"

Possible Problems
-----------------

Specific limitations and problems:
----------------------------------

-  Versions of phenix.get\_cc\_mtz\_mtz up to 1.3-final used a different
   set of defaults, with the values,

::

    scale=True
    keep_f_mag=False
    use_only_refl_present_in_mtz_1=True

These defaults were changed after version 1.3-final in order to make the
results independent of the order of the mtz files and to make the
default be to get the correlation of maps without manipulation.
