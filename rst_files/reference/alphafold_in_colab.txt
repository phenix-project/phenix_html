Running AlphaFold2 in Google CoLab
==================================

You can create a new AlphaFold model using cloud computing and a simple
web interface available from the Phenix GUI.


How to run AlphaFold on Colab
-----------------------------

You will need the 1-letter sequence of your protein (that's all).

To access the site, you can use the AlphaFold button in the Phenix GUI 
or you can go directly to the Phenix AlphaFold 
`Colab notebook <https://colab.research.google.com/github/phenix-project/Colabs/blob/main/alphafold2/AlphaFold2.ipynb>`_ .

Then you paste your sequence into the form, go to the pull-down menu item 
"Runtime" and select "Run all".  That's it.

You wait a few minutes and your AlphaFold model is downloaded automatically
along with some informational files as a zip file.

This version of AlphaFold automatically scans the PDB for templates that
are similar in sequence to your sequence and includes them in the prediction.
This is in addition to finding all the sequence homologues as part of
the core prediction method in AlphaFold.

About Google Colab
------------------

`Google Colab <https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb?utm_source=scs-index>`_  
is a really nice system for sharing and running software.  Anyone
with a Google login can run, share and create notebooks on Colab.  

Colab notebooks have one or more 'cells' that do something and set up 
for the next cell.  You can run an individual cell with a Run button
next to the cell, or you can run all the cells in order with a 
pull-down menu item called "Run all" under the heading "Runtime".

Notebooks can have inputs like numbers or sequences or places to upload
files.  The inputs can be available at the beginning or may appear
during execution.

If something goes wrong, you can (sometimes) fix an input and re-run the
cell where the problem occurred, or all cells starting there.

You do have to pay a little attention to exactly what notebook you are
running.  As notebooks can be easily changed and shared, there can be
many versions of a notebook (as for AlphaFold).

Possible problems
-----------------

If something goes wrong with the run, you can just load the site over
again and start from the beginning.


Background
----------

The Google DeepMind software AlphaFold2 can be run with a Google login
on Google's cloud computing software with Google's Colab notebook service.
The AlphaFold team created an `AlphaFold Colab notebook <https://colab.research.google.com/github/deepmind/alphafold/blob/main/notebooks/AlphaFold.ipynb>`_
and the ColabFold team created a simpler version called `ColabFold: AlphaFold2 w/ MMseqs2 <https://colab.research.google.com/github/sokrypton/ColabFold/blob/main/AlphaFold2.ipynb>`_ .

The notebook for Phenix is a further simplified version of the ColabFold 
notebook suitable for use with Phenix.


Non-commercial use only
-----------------------

Google DeepMind has made the code for AlphaFold2 open source and available to 
anyone.  Note however that the AlphaFold2 database of parameters (required 
for use of AlphaFold2) is licensed only for non-commercial use. That means
that use of this notebook is limited to non-commercial purposes (NonCommercial 
means not primarily intended for or directed towards commercial advantage 
or monetary compensation)

Required citations for using the AlphaFold Colab notebook

If you use a model from the AlphaFold CoLab notebook you should be sure
to cite the following two publications:
