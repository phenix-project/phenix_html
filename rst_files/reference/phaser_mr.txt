Molecular replacement with the Phaser GUI

Overview
--------

`MRage <MRage.html>`_ presents a user-friendly and automated frontend to Phaser,
but especially difficult cases may require finer
control over parameters.  The Phaser-MR GUI exposes all options available in
the standalone command-line Phaser software, and allows use of additional
modes besides MR_AUTO.  It can, for instance, be used to search for individual
components one at a time with modified parameters, or run each stage of the
search (rotation, translation, packing, phasing+refinement) separately.

There is also a simplified GUI for structures with only one component in the
crystal, allowing the relevant files to be dragged and dropped into the interface.
This should only be used for such simple cases, and when no difficulties are
anticipated.

This document only covers configuration of the Phaser GUI; for a detailed
explanation of the various terms and search procedures referenced here as well
as interpretation of results, consult the `overview of molecular replacement
in PHENIX <mr_overview.html>`_ (especially the discussion of "ensembles" and
"ASU contents"), the `Phaser documentation <phaser.html>`_, or the
`Phaser WIKI <http://www.phaser.cimr.cam.ac.uk/index.php/Phaser_Crystallographic_Software>`_.  Some common user questions are discussed at the end of this
section, and in the MR overview page.  New users looking for a step-by-step
introduction should read the `Phaser-MR tutorial <../tutorials/mr.html>`_.

The `tutorial video <https://youtu.be/lJ7t8dgfFjk>`_ is available on the
`Phenix YouTube channel
<https://www.youtube.com/c/phenixtutorials>`_ and covers the
following topics:

- Basic overview
- How to run Phaser MR using the tutorial data.

Input files and mandatory parameters
------------------------------------

The input section is similar to that of MRage, with separate sections for
reflection data, search ensembles, and scattering information.  Unlike the
command-line
version of Phaser, the experimental data may be any file format, and both
intensities and amplitudes (with or without anomalous data) are allowed.
The default mode is "Automated molecular replacement" (MR_AUTO); some of the
other modes require only a subset of the parameters displayed.

All modes require a description of the search ensembles, either
as PDB files (singly, or superimposed as an ensemble), or map coefficients in
MTZ format (e.g. for phasing using a low-resolution EM map).  Adding an
ensemble does not automatically include it in the search; you may, for
instance, supply several alternate ensembles for a chain, and instruct Phaser
to try each in turn (see below).

You must also define the contents of the asymmetric unit (ASU); this is
usually done by supplying information about the sequence (one chain at a time),
mass, or
type and number of residues.  Alternatively, you may give the fractional
ASU contents of each search ensemble, if known.  It is also possible to
additionally specify heavy atoms that contribute to scattering, but this is
rarely necessary.  Note that the ASU contents data does not necessarily have
a 1:1 correspondence with the search ensembles (see FAQ list below for
details).  Even if you are only searching for a single
ensemble out of several (e.g. the protein in a protein-DNA complex), you
must still supply the expected ASU contents of the entire crystal, because
Phaser needs to know what fraction of the whole crystal content each search
model comprises.

Finally, the "Search procedure" tab defines the steps in the MR search,
selected from each input ensemble. This is organized as a tree-like table
with search components as main branches. Expanding a component branch displays the
ensembles used for the searches. Expanding an ensemble branch displays the name
of the ensemble's constituent coordinate files or the name of the electron density
file. Specifying more than one ensemble per
component will result in the ensemble yielding the best solution being used.
You do not need to search for all ensembles at once, as described below.

Additional parameters
---------------------

The "Output" button at the top of the window controls basic behavior such as
the resulting file names and verbosity.  All other parameters are set by
clicking the "Other settings" button, which will open a large dialog window
with assorted controls.  (Like most such windows in the Phenix GUI, only
a subset of basic controls may be displayed at first, but this can be changed
by selecting options in the "User level" menu at the bottom of the window.)
The available parameters will be slightly different depending on which mode
you have selected.

.. _use-solution:

Re-using previous results
-------------------------

Phaser can be instructed to start from a previous partial solution; this does
not use a partial PDB file, but rather the saved results of a previous run.
For example, a two-part MR solution may be obtained by running in MR_AUTO
mode to place one ensemble, then modifying the parameters, selecting the
previous run as the partial solution, and searching for the second ensemble.
To do this, select the result which you want to use as input from the menu
labeled "Use partial solution from previous job" (all previous Phaser jobs for
the current project will be listed in the menu). It is best to do this by
modifying the configuration of the GUI from the previous Phaser run instead of
starting from scratch, because the stored solutions do not contain the
definitions of the search ensembles. This means that the existing ensemble
definitions must be left unchanged when defining any ensembles needed for
further searches.

You may also run each mode separately, e.g. the fast rotation function
followed by the fast translation function using the previous result, and so
on.  There are some restrictions on which modes may use which results, thus
you may not follow a fast rotation function with packing analysis.

How to read a Phaser molecular replacement log file (Phaser-MR)
---------------------------------------------------------------

A summary of your Phaser molecular replacement results can be found in the
very last section of your Phaser-MR log file. It may look something like
this, where everything between "AUTOMATED MOLECULAR REPLACEMENT" and
"Citations for Phaser:" is part of the summary:

Here are the elements of this Phaser-MR summary:

1.  Summary:

::

  ** SINGLE solution

This run yielded a single solution.  Typically a
run with a single solution is a confident run.  A run with MULTIPLE solutions
is typically low-confidence, and it is even common for the correct solution not
to be among the solutions found.

2.  Output model and reflections file from a Phaser-MR run:

::

  ** Solution written to PDB file:  GUI_crystals_phaser.1.pdb 
  ** Solution written to MTZ file:  GUI_crystals_phaser.1.mtz

The output mtz file from Phaser-MR molecular replacement will contain 
the input X-ray data as well as coefficients for a sigmaA-weighted map.

3. Table of information about the Phaser-MR solution and its history

::

  Solution annotation (history):
  SOLU SET  RF*0 TF*0 LLG=8776 TFZ==67.6 PAK=1 LLG=8779 TFZ==70.2
  SOLU SPAC I 4
  SOLU 6DIM ENSE ense_1 EULER    0.0    0.0    0.0 FRAC -1.00 -0.00 -1.00 BFAC -1.03 #TFZ==67.6
  SOLU ENSEMBLE ense_1 VRMS DELTA -0.1 #RMSD  0.7 #VRMS  0.6

The first line of this history gives the initial LLG and TFZ of the solution
(8776 and 67.6), followed by the values after refinement (8779 and 70.2).
The space group of the solution was I4.  The rotation and translations are
represented by the EULER and FRAC values. The VRMS is the refined RMS variance,
RMSD is the input RMSD value, and DELTA is the shift with respect to this RMSD.

After molecular replacement with Phser-MR, you are looking for a high 
final LLG value (60 or more usually indicates a
confident solution), and a high TFZ (a good value may be in the range of 7 
or more).  Make sure the space group is plausible. You should expect your
VRMS value to be similar to the input RMSD (small DELTA), and typically 
the VRMS value will be in the range of 0.5-1 for AlphaFold models and 1-2 for
homology models.

What to do next after Phaser-MR molecular replacement
-----------------------------------------------------

After Phaser-MR molecular replacement you will usually want to have a look
at the sigmaA-weighted map that you can draw with the Phaser output mtz file,
along with the output Phaser model in the pdb file, for example using Coot.
The map should match the model reasonably well, though you should not 
expect an exact fit.  Next you may want to refine the model with PhenixRefine,
or you may want to automatically rebuild the model with AutoBuild, or
you may want to rebuild by hand.
