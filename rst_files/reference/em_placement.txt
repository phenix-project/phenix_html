Purpose
-------

The em_placement tool docks the input model in a cryo-EM reconstruction, using
the half-maps in an adaptive search strategy.

How em_placement works
----------------------

The half-maps are compared and analysed to determine signal and noise power as
smooth functions in Fourier space. This information is used to predict whether
or not a rotation search with a structural model over the full map volume is
likely to succeed. If not, the maps are divided into sub-volumes small enough that
the noise will be reduced to a level where signal from the rotation search can be
detected. Following this, translation searches in the full map volume or the
sub-volumes are carried out. Finally, rigid-body refinement is carried out using
spherical sub-volumes centered on potential solutions to give the final solutions
and confidence indicators.

A log-likelihood-gain (LLG) score greater than 60 suggests that a solution is
significantly better than random.

NB: the statistical analysis requires the half-maps to correspond to the
full volume of the cryo-EM reconstruction, so cut-out boxes cannot be used.
Half-maps are required for a search over the whole reconstruction volume,
whereas just a single full map can be used optionally for a search over a
local volume.

Running em_placement
--------------------

There is an EMplacement GUI to run em_placement, but it can also be controlled by
an input script using the phil syntax. A basic phil script would look like
the following, in which a model derived from the membrane domain of PDB entry
4cof is docked into the reconstruction of the GABA receptor in EMDB entry 11657.

::

  em_placement
  {
    remove_phasertng_folder = True

    map_model
    {
      half_map = emd_11657_half_map_1.map
      half_map = emd_11657_half_map_2.map
      best_resolution = 1.7
      point_group_symmetry = C5
      sequence_composition = 7a5v.fa
    }

    biological_unit {
      molecule
      {
        molecule_name = 4cofA_membrane
        model_file = 4cofA_membrane.pdb
        starting_model_vrms = 1.2
      }
    }

  }

If the phil script is in a file named docking_script.phil, the search would
be run from the command-line as follows.

::

  phenix.voyager.em_placement docking_script.phil

Most parameters specified in this script have been named in a way intended to
convey the purpose of that parameter.

The remove_phasertng_folder parameter is activated to clean up the graph
database produced by phasertng, which could be used in other circumstances as
part of a larger automation framework or for debugging.

The point_group_symmetry feature is only used at the moment to optionally
generate a full assembly from a single copy.

The sequence_composition parameter specifies the name of a file containing the
sequences of all the components in the reconstruction.

By default, em_placement carries out an adaptive search, which is normally
recommended. Aspects of this search can be over-ridden with expert user keywords
specified below, for example to force a full 6D search or to force only a single
rotation search over the whole ordered volume regardless of the estimated signal.
