Theory and Background
=====================

Amber refinement in Phenix combines the power and functionality of
Phenix crystallographic refinement with the Amber molecular mechanics
force field for geometry restraints. Amber restraints replace the
conventional set of Engh&Huber restraints. In addition to bond, angle
and dihedral terms, electrostatics and van der Waals
attractive/dispersive interactions are computed. Calls to Amber's
energy and gradient calculation engines are seamlessly integrated
through internal libraries shared with Phenix. Refinement with Amber
molecular mechanics has been shown to improve model quality and reduce
overfitting as compared to conventional restraints.

Running refinement with Phenix and Amber
========================================

The Phenix user should install the latest AmberTools. The interface in
Phenix was updated to AmberTools16 on 1 AUG 2016. There is no support
for older versions of AmberTools.  AmberTools is avaialable free of
charge at www.ambermd.org. Follow the installation instructions in the
Amber manual. In particular make sure to set the AMBERHOME environment
variable. There is a file for setting your environment
($AMBERHOME/amber.sh or $AMBERHOME/amber.csh script, depending on the
shell) that can be used in conjunction with Amber. This is required
for the installation using Amber and can be added to the appropriate
login script (bashrc or cshrc) but only AMBERHOME needs to be set for
use inside Phenix. This is because Phenix uses "dispatchers" which
setup all the details of the environment from AMBERHOME.

To build Amber, there are instructions in the Amber distribution, but
there are some things that can make things run smoothly when installing
Amber specfically for Phenix. Run, in $AMBERHOME, the updates command:

::
	[~:]$ ./update_amber --update

Next:

::
	[~:]$ ./configure --no-updates --with-python `which phenix.python` -noX11 -macAccelerate -nofftw3 <compiler>

The compiler is based on the OS and available compilers. The -macAccelerate is
ignored in non-OSX machines. The 'make' should now compile Amber using the
Phenix python:

::
 	[~:]$ make -j 2 install

and complete with something like:

::

  ==============================================================
  /home/builder/slave/phenix-externals-regression-bot/modules/amber/src/Makefile not found, or -noamber was set.
  This is expected if you do not have Amber16.
  ==============================================================

To create the bridge between Phenix and Amber (and setup the dispatchers), run:

::

	[~:]$ phenix.build_amber_interface

This will create a link to $AMBERHOME in the Phenix installation,
reconfigure Phenix to include Amber and build the code required to
prepare Amber files and run them seamlessly with Phenix. Amber will remain
linked and therefore $AMBERHOME should remain set to the Amber installation.
To test if the interface has installed successfully the user may go to the 
Phenix modules/amber_adaptbx directory and run:

::

	amber.run_tests

To run Amber in Phenix, in addition to a PDB file, a topology and a
coordinate file must be provided for Amber. You can easily create
these files by using the provided AmberPrep utility:

::

  phenix.fetch_pdb 4Lzt --mtz
  phenix.AmberPrep 4Lzt.pdb

which will generate three files.

::

  4amber_4Lzt.prmtop
  4amber_4Lzt.rst7
  4phenix_4Lzt.pdb
	
The first two are the Amber files and the last one is the PDB file that matches
the two Amber files for atom order and must be used in phenix.refine replacing
4Lzt.pdb. Having created the input files, refinement can be run as follows:

::

  phenix.refine 4phenix_4Lzt.pdb 4Lzt.mtz use_amber=True topology_file_name=4amber_4Lzt.prmtop coordinate_file_name=4amber_4Lzt.rst7

Here is list of keywords:

  REQUIRED KEYWORDS
    use_amber - turn on refinement with Amber geometry
      restraints. ("True" or "False"; default = False)
    topology_file_name - relative path to the Amber topology file. This is 
      the *prmtop* file created by AmberPrep.
    coordinate_file_name - relative path to the Amber coordinate file. 
      This is the *rst7* file created by AmberPrep.
  OPTIONAL KEYWORDS
    wxc_factor - relative weight factor between the x-ray and 
      the Amber geometry restraint terms in refinement. 
      By default this is set to 0.1 which multiplies the standard wxc_scale
      which has a default of 0.5 for the x-ray and E&H restraints. 
      (Float; default=0.1)

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:

1. We also provide the possibility to energetically optimize model coordinates 
using Amber's force field rather than the set of Engh & Huber restraints. 
This leads to models of improved quality. This minimization can be run 
as follows:

::

	phenix.geometry_minimization 4amber_xyz.pdb amber.use=True topology_file_name=4amber_4Lzt.prmtop coordinate_file_name=4amber_4Lzt.rst7

2. AmberPrep contains additional options that the user may wish to use.
Run:

::

  phenix.AmberPrep --show-defaults

to view all of the options. Here is a list of the optional keywords:

  minimise - type of energy minimization to perform. Possible options:

    amber_all - optimize coordinates of all atoms using Amber's minimizer

    amber_h - optimize only hydrogen positions using Amber's minimizer (default)

    phenix_all - optimize coordinates of all atoms using phenix minimizer

    off - do not optimize atoms

  clean - remove temporary files (on/off, default=on)

  redq - use Amber's redq force field instead of the default (currently 
      ff14SB). redq is a version of ff14SB that mitigates 
      the partial charges on charged amino acid side chains. In theory 
      this should account for the electrostatic screening effects of 
      the unmodelled solvent molecules. In practice our tests have not 
      shown any improvement in refinement when using the reduced charge 
      (redq) force field, but users are free to experiment (True/False,
      default=False)

3. Refinement with Amber currently has several limitations. All atoms
must be explicitely modelled and there can be no gaps in the peptide
or nucleic acid backbone. If hydrogen atoms are missing, they will be
added automatically by AmberPrep but missing heavy atoms should first
be manually modelled in by the user. Amber does not currently model
alternate conformations and AmberPrep will only retain the first
alternate conformer of each atom. Solutions to these two limitations
are currently in development.

4. Metal-containing ligands are not supported by 
Amber.

5. Atoms at special positions will most often produce high energy
clashes with Amber and usually will not work. If the atom is a solvent
molecule, the user may try to refine without it. If the structure
contains atoms at special positions, a warning will be issued when
running AmberPrep.

FOR ADVANCED USERS:

1. Phenix automatically recognizes the user's environment at
runtime. Therefore, if you have multiple versions of Amber installed
and would like to switch between them, it is sufficient to change the
AMBERHOME variable and source the corresponding $AMBERHOME/amber.sh
script before running Phenix. However, if you are using MDGX for your
gradient calculation (the default is to use Sander and MDGX use should
only be reserved for advanced users) you will also need to change the
soft link to Amber in your Phenix modules directory.

2. To use MDGX instead of Sander for gradient calculation, use
md_engine=mdgx keyword for phenix.refine. The default md_engine is
Sander.

3. phenix.refine with Amber also has a hidden wxc_factor parameter. In
ordinary refinement the x-ray term is scaled by the ratio of the
gradient norms between the x-ray and geometry terms times the
wxc_factor (default 0.5 when using E&H; recommended 0.025 when using
Amber). If wxc_factor is set, the ratio of the gradient norms will be
ignored and the x-ray term will be scaled by wxc_factor directly. This
is an experimental feature and has not been shown to improve
refinement in any way.

4. The advanced user may wish to change the Amber force field used to
impose geometry restraints. Be default the force field used is
ff14SB. This can easily be changed by modifing AmberPrep script,
run_tleap() method, to source a different force field from Amber.

5. phenix.AmberPrep performs several important actions to prepare
files for refinement with Phenix and Amber. This includes:

  a. checks for existence of ligands and non-standard small molecules. Derives Amber parameters using eLBOW and Antechamber

  b. cleans and modifies PDB file for conformity with Amber
  
  c. runs TLEaP to prepare Amber topology and coordinate files

  d. runs Amber's XtalUtilities to preapre Amber inputs that conform to the given crystallographic space group

  e. adds missing hydrogen atoms and possibly missing side chain heavy atoms

  f. creates a PDB input file for Phenix that corresponds in atom order and content to the Amber input files
