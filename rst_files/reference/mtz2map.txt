========================
FFT-ing map coefficients
========================

If you already have map coefficients in an MTZ file and just want to run an
FFT to produce X-plor or CCP4 map files, use ``phenix.fft`` or
``phenix.mtz2map`` (these are synonyms for the same program).  In most
cases this can be run automatically by passing the name of the MTZ file.
MTZ files generated by ``phenix.maps``, ``phenix.refine``, SOLVE/RESOLVE, and
REFMAC are supported, and additional combinations of map coefficients are
possible if defined by the user.  By default, output files will take the
base name of the MTZ file, with the appropriate map type appended if it
can be guessed from the column labels, otherwise a unique integer, followed
by the file type extension (.ccp4 or .xplor).

Other map types
===============

  - For isomorphous difference maps (Fobs-Fobs),
    use ``phenix.fobs_minus_fobs_map`` (documentation to be added).

  - For omit maps, including composite omit maps and iterative build omit
    maps, use the `AutoBuild wizard <autobuild.html>`_.

  - You can also generate a simple simulated-annealing omit map by deleting
    the relevant part of the molecule and running `phenix.refine
    <refinement.html>`_ with ``simulated_annealing=True``.  (This is essentially
    the same was what is done by AutoBuild, however.)
