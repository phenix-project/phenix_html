Tips and Tricks
===============

Model completeness
------------------

One of the most important points about Quantum Chemistry is that it is an
all-electron_ method. This means that **all** atoms (and electrons) need to
be specified in order to perform the correct calculation. This is a case where
GIGO_ will really bite you. In refinement, missing atoms are not critical but
QM missing atoms are catastrophic.

The QI module
calculates the charge based on the atoms in the input model (and the
selection) but care must be taken to ensure that the input model is correct
down to the protonation. Besides calculating the incorrect result, the QM
calculation can have difficulty converging thus resulting in excessive run
times.

Timings
-------

QM calculations scale as a power of the number of atoms. This means that
increasing the buffer can greatly affect the timings.

Using the parallel features in MOPAC and Orca are generally not linear so
the QI module has a feature to prefer simple parallelism on based on jobs
that can be useful for some situations.
