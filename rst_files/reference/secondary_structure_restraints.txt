phenix.secondary_structure_restraints
=====================================

Description
-----------

It is a tool to generate secondary structure annotation in various formats using pdb file. When HELIX/SHEET records are present in input pdb file, no searching occurs, they are used as source of information about protein secondary structure. 

There are several methods available to search protein secondary structure:

- ksdssp (default): uses KSDSSP, the same as stand-alone tool `phenix.ksdssp <ksdssp.html>`__
- dssp Slightly different method by Nat Echols, stand-alone tool is mmtbx.dssp
- from_ca: Tries to find protein secondary structure from position of C-alpha atoms. Finds more SS elements than other methods, works better when the structure is distorted (author Tom Terwilliger).


Output format:

- phenix (default): Phil parameter file suitable to use with all Phenix tools except phenix.refine
- phenix.refine: Phil parameter file suitable to use with phenix.refine
- pdb: HELIX/SHEET records in PDB format
- pymol: output pymol script which can be loaded in pymol along with pdb file to show hydrogen bonds
