phenix.secondary_structure_restraints
=====================================

Description
-----------

It is a tool to generate secondary structure annotation in various formats using pdb file. When HELIX/SHEET records are present in input pdb file, no searching occurs, they are used as source of information about protein secondary structure. To force automatic detection of protein secondary structure elements, one needs to remove them from input file.

There are several methods available to search protein secondary structure:

- ksdssp (default): uses KSDSSP
- dssp: slightly different method by Nat Echols, stand-alone tool is mmtbx.dssp
- from_ca: tries to find protein secondary structure from position of C-alpha atoms. Finds more SS elements than other methods, works better when the structure is distorted. (author Tom Terwilliger).
- cablam: CaBLAM uses CA-trace geometry to validate protein backbone. Since the CA trace is more reliably modeled from low-resolution density than the full backbone trace, CaBLAM can identify modeling errors and intended secondary structure elements in low-resolution models. (author Christopher Williams).


Output format:

- phenix (default): Phil parameter file suitable to use with all Phenix tools except phenix.refine
- phenix.refine: Phil parameter file suitable to use with phenix.refine
- pdb: HELIX/SHEET records in PDB format
- pymol: output pymol script which can be loaded in pymol along with pdb file to show hydrogen bonds
