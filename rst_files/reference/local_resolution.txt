Purpose
-------

The routine local_resolution is a tool for creating a local resolution
map showing the local resolution of a cryo-EM map and having the same
gridding as the cryo-EM map

Usage and how local_resolution works:
-------------------------------------

Local resolution is calculated in small boxes cut out from the cryo-EM map,
where the density near the edges of each box is masked so that it gradually
diminishes to zero at the edges.  Then the values of local resolution are
smoothed and placed at grid points of a full-size map matching the original
map.

The local resolution map can be used to color a map in display programs 
such as ChimeraX.  In ChimeraX you can simply load in your original map and the
local resolution map and then specify:

color sample #1  map #2  palette rainbow

to color map #1 based on the resolution values in map #2.

Procedure used by local_resolution 
----------------------------------

The basic inputs to local_resolution are:

::

  Two unmasked half-maps

Optional inputs are:

::

  nominal resolution

Examples
--------

Standard run of local_resolution:
---------------------------------

You can use local_resolution to get the local resolution in a cryo-EM map:

::

   phenix.local_resolution half_map_A.mrc half_map_B.mrc

Possible Problems
-----------------

If the half-maps are not actually independent the procedure will not work well

Specific limitations and problems:
