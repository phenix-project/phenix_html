Introduction
============

Histidine can be protonated on either or both of the two nitrogen atoms of the
imidazole moiety. Each of the three possible forms occur as a result of the
stereochemical environment of the histidine sidechain. In an atomic model,
comparing the possible protonation states *in situ*, looking at possible
H-bonding and metal coordination, it is possible to predict which is most
likely correct. We describe a more direct method that uses quantum mechanical
methods to calculate – also *in situ* – the minimum geometry and energy for
comparison, and therefore more accurate identification of the most likely
protonation state.

QMF is part of the Quantum Interface (QI) module that covers the interaction of
Phenix with QM packages.

Running an example
==================

QMF can only be run stand-alone in the mmtbx.quantum_interface procedure as it's
not reasonable to do this during refinement. Using the same example as QMR of
PDB:**4w53**, download from the PDB website using::

  ~> phenix.fetch_pdb 4w53 --mtz

Command to produce PHIL scope for QM minimisation using
mmtbx.quantum_interface is::

  ~> mmtbx.quantum_interface 4w53.pdb iterate_NQH=HIS

which will fail because of the bulk test for hydrogen atoms.

::

   Sorry: Model must have Hydrogen atoms

Also note that the
write_qmr_phil=True option writes a PHIL file. In this example, the format of
the PHIL file works for QI interface but the default works for phenix.refine.Add Hydrogen atoms to the model using::

  ~> phenix.ready_set 4w53.pdb

which produces a file with hydrogens atoms – 4w53.updated.pdb. It also may
produce a restraints file that needs to be used next but in this case
because the restraints for BNZ (benzene) are shipped with Phenix it is not
necessary to supply to the program unless you want a different list of restraints
(not ideal values).
This file can be created cheaply but is needed as the skeleton for the QMR
values to be inserted in the bond, angle and torsion restraints. So, we
can repeat the quantum interface command with the new files.::

  ~> mmtbx.quantum_interface 4w53.updated.pdb iterate_NQH=HIS

This will prompt for the selection of the ligand which in this case is “1”.

::

     1 : "chain A and resid   31  and resname HIS"
     2 : "chain A and resid  200  and resname MBN"
     3 : "chain A and resid  201  and resname EPE"

  Enter selection by choosing number or typing a new one ~>

The result is a PHIL scope for MBN QMR restraints::

  4w53.updated_A_31_HIS.phil.

There is also a command given to run the six configurations.

::

  ~> mmtbx.quantum_interface 4w53.updated.pdb iterate_NQH=HIS 4w53.updated_A_31_HIS.phil  run_qmr=True qi.nproc=6

Note that you can edit the number of nproc to run all six configurations at once.

Once the jobs are done the important metrics are listed in the table::
