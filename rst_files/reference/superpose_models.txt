Purpose
-------

Superpose moving model on fixed model. Optionally morph the moving
model to be similar to the fixed model and trim it back to the parts that
match.

Usage
-----

How superpose_models works:
---------------------------

The superpose_models tool can use either sequence-based alignment with
least-squares fitting or SSM-based (secondary-structure-matching) 
superposition.


LSQ fitting (sequence-based alignment and least-squares fitting)
----------------------------------------------------------------

The LSQ fitting method consists of least-squares superposition of two selected
parts from two pdb files. If no selections is provided for fixed and
moving models the whole content of both input PDB files is used for
superposition. If the number of atoms in fixed and moving models is
different and the models contain amino-acid residues then the sequence
alignment is performed and the matching residues (CA atoms by default,
can be changed by the user) are used for superposition. Note that
selected (and/or matching) atoms are the atoms used to find the
superposition operators while these operators are applied to the whole
moving structure.

SSM matching
------------

SSM matching in phenix.superpose_models consists
of identifying secondary structure in the two models, indexing all pairs of
secondary structure elements, and finding sets of matching pairs in the
two structures.  Normally the basic unit of a match is a set of three pairs
of secondary structure elements (they can be overlapping) with the same
spatial arrangement in the two structures.  Such a match is called a triple
in superpose_models. 

A matching triples yields a unique orientation of the moving model.  Matching
triples are grouped into sets in which all the triples yield nearly the same
orientation. Then the transformations suggested by the largest groups are 
each tested by using them to superimpose the moving model on the fixed model
and noting the number of residues that superimpose.



Options
-------

  LSQ fitting.  This is the default superposition method.

  SSM matching. This is an alternative to LSQ fitting.  It can be useful if
  your models do not have similar sequences

  Morphing.  The best-fitting superimposed moving models can be morphed by
  calculation of a real-space distortion field that changes over a typical 
  distance of about 10 A (set by the parameter distortion_field_length).
  This is a way to superpose one model on another and then make them as 
  similar as possible by applying a smooth distortion to the moving model

  Trimming.  The superposed (and optionally morphed) moving model can 
  be trimmed to remove segments that are very different from the fixed model.

  SSM match to map.  You can supply a map and specify ssm_match_to_map=True.
  The tool will search for helices and strands in the map and generate a
  target helices_strands model.  Then a brute force SSM matching of your
  moving model to the helices_strands model is carried out and matches are
  scored with map-model correlation. This option can also be carried out
  with the dock_in_map tool.
  Note this option does not support trimming or morphing.

  Brute force SSM.  You can supply a target model that has helices and strands.
  Helices and strands in your moving model will be matched to those in the
  target model to superpose it.  You can also supply a map_file and specify
  score_superpose_brute_force_with_cc if you wish.
  Note this option does not support trimming or morphing.


Examples
--------

Standard run of superpose_models:
------------------------------------

Running superpose_models is easy. From the command-line you can type:

::

    phenix.superpose_models fixed_model=fixed_model.pdb \
       moving_model=moving_model.pdb morph=true trim=true


This will superimpose moving_model.pdb on fixed_model.pdb, morph it (gradual
adjustment of atomic positions with location along the chain and in space),
and trim moving_model back to the region where they are similar.

To superpose a model on a map you can say:

::

    phenix.superpose_models map_file=map.ccp4 moving_model=moving_model.pdb

This will find helices and strands in map.ccp4 and superpose moving_model.pdb
on those secondary structure elements.

Possible Problems
-----------------

Specific limitations and problems:
----------------------------------


-  When using LSQ fitting a different number of atoms in selection_fixed 
   and selection_moving can lead to failure if sequence alignment  is not
   successful.

-  More than one model in one PDB file (separated with MODEL-ENDMDL) is not
   supported.
