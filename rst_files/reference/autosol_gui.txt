Introduction
------------

NOTE: this document is mainly an introduction for users who are not familiar
with AutoSol (or experimental phasing in general), rather than a comprehensive
reference for the program.  The documentation for the `command-line version
<autosol.html>`_ covers the full range of options and functionality.

AutoSol is an experimental phasing pipeline that combines HySS (Hybrid
Substructure Search) for finding heavy-atom sites, Phaser or SOLVE for
calculating experimental phases, and RESOLVE for density modification and
(optional) model-building.  It will automatically try multiple solutions as
necessary and determine which is most likely to give the desired result;
several different measures of solution quality (discussed below) are supplied.
With good data, a partial model can be obtained for an average-size protein
(30kD) in under an hour, starting only from scaled reflections and a sequence
file.

The examples below mostly use the p9-sad example included in the Phenix
distribution.  If you have not previously performed experimental phasing or
used AutoSol, we recommend setting up a tutorial project in the GUI and running
the full example.  Because these data extend to a relatively high resolution
(1.7A), AutoSol can build a nearly complete model with R-factors well below
0.3, but to save time you may prefer to truncate the resolution at 2.5A,
which will finish in less than 15 minutes.

A `tutorial video <https://youtu.be/_Olb8_hYn4U>`_ is available on the
`Phenix YouTube channel
<https://www.youtube.com/c/phenixtutorials>`_ and covers the
following topics:

- basic overview
- how to run AutoSol via the GUI
- how to interpret the output

------------------------------------
Input files and mandatory parameters
------------------------------------

Most users will have anomalous data from a single crystal (or merged from
multiple similar crystals); although SIR and MIR phasing (with or
without anomalous information) is supported, these types of experiment are
typically done as a last resort.  At a minimum, one reflections file
containing scaled anomalous intensities or amplitudes is required.  Any input
format is supported, and in most cases AutoSol is run immediately after data
processing.  Files can be added to the input list by dragging them into the
main window, or by clicking the "Browse" button and selecting them from a file
dialog.  The GUI will automatically determine the file type, usually assuming
that a SAD or MAD experiment is being performed.  In most cases the data
labels for reflections will be guessed automatically (in the p9-sad example,
only one set of values is available anyway).

You should always supply a sequence file (usually in FASTA format) if you have
this information, although it is optional if you do not perform model-building.
If more than one chain is present, multiple sequences may be specified in a
single file.  At this time, AutoSol (and AutoBuild) can build either protein
or nucleic acid structures, but not both at once.

When you add a reflections file, additional controls will appear for specifying
experiment details such as heavy atom type and number, and anomalous scattering
parameters.  If you are trying to phase using selenomethionine (SeMet), the
number of atoms can be automatically determined from the sequence.  The
wavelength is required for SAD but optional for other phasing methods;
anomalous coefficients (f' and f'') are optional for SAD (but highly
recommended if they were measured), and required for MAD.  If you did not
measure these parameters at the beamline using a fluorescence scan, they can be
guessed based on the wavelength by clicking the button below the file list.
For MAD phasing, the experimentally determined values are more essential, and
often make the difference between an uninterpretable map and an obviously
correct solution.  A different example (gene-5-mad, also included in the PHENIX
distribution) using multiple wavelengths is shown below; the inputs are only
slightly more complicated than for SAD.  (In this case the wavelengths and
anomalous coefficients are listed in the file README.txt in the example
directory.)

.. image:: ../images/autosol_mad_input.png

Assuming that the space group and unit cell are automatically extracted from
the reflection files, most of the other parameters can be left on the defaults,
although in the first image above we have changed the resolution to 2.5A.  The
p9-sad example contains only a single protein chain in the asymmetric unit so the
number of NCS copies can be left blank, but you should enter this if you are
confident of the crystal contents.  We recommend leaving the model-building on,
since it is the single most useful measure of whether the final map is
interpretable or not.  If you have an RNA or DNA crystal, you may explicitly
set the chain type by clicking the "All parameters" button, select "Crystal
info" from the menu, and change the drop-down menu for "Chain type".

Three other types of input file are optional but may be useful in special
cases: heavy-atom sites (in PDB format) from an external program such as
SHELXD, phases (in MTZ format) from an MR model or another phasing program, or
a molecular replacement solution (in PDB format).  The use of pre-defined sites
is not discussed here as it is essentially very simple.  External phases can be
used to help SOLVE find heavy-atom sites in phasing methods other than SAD.
The combination of MR and SAD is described at the end of this document.

Running AutoSol
---------------

Once you start AutoSol, a new tab is added to the GUI, with multiple sub-tabs
displaying job status and results.  The first tab prints the log output and
summary of the current best statistics for the run once they are available.

.. image:: ../images/autosol_log.png

The second tab displays a list of the most important output files in the job
directory created by AutoSol.  Buttons for viewing the results in graphics
applications will be activated once the necessary files are detected.  The
image below is the appearance of this tab at the end of running the p9-sad
example.

Xtriage
=======

The first step in the phasing pipeline is running the data analysis program
`phenix.xtriage <xtriage_gui.html>`_, which identifies potential problems such
as twinning, translational pseudo-symmetry, or weak anomalous signal.
(Xtriage can also be run by itself, starting from the main GUI or the toolbar
button in AutoSol, but you do not need to do this if AutoSol has already run
it for you.)  The graphs and summary text from Xtriage may be viewed by
clicking the button that appears in this section.  We recommend that you read
the `documentation for the Xtriage GUI <xtriage_gui.html>`_ for more
information about interpreting the output.  If AutoSol is not successful in
phasing your structure, it is especially important to look over the Xtriage
results before spending more effort on the same data.

Heavy-atom search
=================

Within a few minutes, information on heavy-atom site finding will appear in
the third tab.  There may be more than one solution if you are running a MAD
or MIR experiment, but AutoSol will pick the one mostly likely to be correct
for further analysis.  The most important statistic here is the number of
sites located; it will usually be less than the final number of refined sites,
and the difference will be made up in the phasing step.  If the number of
sites is much less than expected, you may not have sufficient anomalous signal
in your data, or (when not using SeMet) the heavy atom may not be bound.

Phasing and density modification
================================

Phasing is done by Phaser for SAD experiments, SOLVE for everything else, but
the reported statistics are the same, and provide the first indication whether
the structure is solveable by AutoSol.  If Phaser is run, additional
heavy-atom sites will be added based on the log-likelihood-gradient map, and
phases recalculated using the new sites.  Phasing is followed by density
modification in RESOLVE; these two steps combined take only a couple of
minutes for an average-sized structure.  Once solutions are finished with
each step, you may view the maps and sites in Coot or PyMOL by clicking one
of the buttons below the solution lists:

.. image:: ../images/autosol_solutions.png

The map produce by the phasing step will usually be uninterpretable due to
poor phase quality, especially in SAD experiments where the phase ambiguity
can not be resolved.  The images below show the experimental maps (over the
entire unit cell) for the p9-sad example; first the map from Phaser, then
the density-modified map from RESOLVE, in identical orientations and contour
levels.  Note that while the protein region is more electron-dense even in
the initial SAD map, the boundary between protein and bulk solvent is
impossible to determine.  However, even in the map from Phaser, the heavy-atom
sites should be clearly inside strong density.

.. image:: ../images/p9_phased_maps.png

The phasing and density modification steps generate several statistics; the
`full AutoSol manual <autosol.html>`_ provides a detailed explanation of these
(see the section "Scoring of heavy-atom solutions").  Some approximate
guidelines for their interpretation:

  - The Figure of Merit (FOM) is an estimate of phase quality, ranging from
    0 to 1.  For SAD, above 0.45 is very good, and between 0.25 and 0.45 is
    marginal.  For MAD, these thresholds increase to 0.45 and 0.65.

  - The Overall Score (also BAYES-CC) is simply a correlation coefficient
    multiplied by 100.  The higher this number is, the better the solution.

  - The R-factor for density modification is calculated by performing an
    inverse Fourier transform on the density-modified map to obtain F(calc),
    and comparing this to F(obs).  This is on the same scale as a refinement
    R-factor, so below 0.3 is ideal; however, a low value does not guarantee
    a usable solution.

  - The "skew" is a measure of the deviation of the distribution of electron
    density values in the raw phased map from a Gaussian;  a macromolecular
    crystal will have a large "tail" of very high density values.  A skew of
    0.2 is usually very good.

Model-building
==============

The automated model-building step is the most time-consuming stage, but by
far the most useful indication of success.  Building is done by RESOLVE,
and alternated with refinement in phenix.refine.  AutoSol will automatically
build SeMet residues when appropriate, based on heavy-atom positions.  If
possible, the user-provided sequence will be docked into the peptide chain.
A schematic of the sequence and current model coverage (including secondary
structure content) will be added in a new tab once a PDB file is available.
If you have the model and map open in Coot or PyMOL, double-clicking on any
residue or secondary structure element will zoom to that region.

.. image:: ../images/autosol_seq.png

The final model is rarely complete and may contain gross errors, but
a genuine solution is usually unambiguous based on visual inspection,
the refinement R-factors, and the correlation coefficient.

.. image:: ../images/p9_final.png

If using the full resolution range of the p9-sad example, an R-free below
0.25 is possible; when truncating at 2.5A, the R-free is nearly 0.35, but
this is still obviously correct.  An R-free between 0.4 and 0.5 is usually
indicative of a solved structure, but may indicate poor resolution and/or
low-quality phases.  In any case, running the more comprehensive (but slower)
AutoBuild wizard often leads to significant improvement.  R-free above 0.5
is rarely usable; even if the phases are approximately correct, the map is
not interpretable enough to build automatically.

What to do next
===============

**Important:** if you are going to use the final model from AutoSol in further
rounds of building and refinement, it is essential that you use the
reflections in the file exptl_fobs_phases_freeR_flags_X.mtz (where X is the
solution number), which will be listed in the Summary tab.  This contains
the R-free set used for refinement during building; failing to use these data
will bias the R-free in future refinements.  It also contains experimental
phase information (Hendrickson-Lattman coefficients), which may be useful
as additional restraints during refinement.

Assuming that you have a correct solution, there are several immediate options
for improving the model.  Validation at this stage is usually not worthwhile,
as many of the automatic procedures may yield a significant improvement right
away.  We generally recommend running the AutoBuild wizard, which will
usually drop R-free by several percent if not more.  This can be started by
clicking the button next to the list of output files in the Summary tab;
appropriate files will be pre-loaded, including heavy-atom sites.  AutoBuild
may take several hours to run, but if you have a multi-core system it can be
set to run in parallel.

With a very good solution, such as the p9-sad data with the full resolution
range, the model from AutoSol may be good enough to jump directly to
running phenix.refine.  At this point, simulated annealing will probably
be helpful; at moderate-to-high resolutions (2.5A or better), you should
also turn on rotamer fitting and solvent picking.

What to do if AutoSol fails
===========================

The most common reason for experimental phasing to fail is poor data quality -
this may mean radiation damage, low signal-to-noise ratio, severe
incompleteness, very little anomalous signal (sometimes due to lack of
high-occupancy heavy-atom sites), or lattice pathologies such as twinning or
pseudo-translation.  The Xtriage output may be helpful in diagnosing faults in
the data.

If the data are of relatively good quality and anomalous signal is present but
few or no heavy-atom sites were found, it may be helpful to supply additional
input files.  Heavy-atom sites identified by another program are one
possibility; another is a partial molecular replacement solution, which can be
used to bootstrap MR-SAD phasing.  In MR-SAD, Phaser uses the
log-likelihood-gradient completion algorithm to add anomalous scatterers to the
molecular replacement solution.  The resulting phases combine information from
both sources, MR and SAD.  This procedure may be successful in situations where
neither MR nor SAD is sufficient by itself.  To run MR-SAD, first carry out MR
using either the Phaser-MR or `MRage <MRage.html>`_ GUI;
when it is finished, use the molecular replacement solution as a partial
model file in the AutoSol GUI.
