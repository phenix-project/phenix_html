AlphaFold and Phenix
====================

You can use the predicted models from AlphaFold and other prediction
software in Phenix.  Using these models can be very helpful in structure
determination because the models can be very accurate over much of their
length and the models come with accuracy estimates that allow removal
of poorly-predicted regions.

Overall procedure for using AlphaFold models in Phenix
------------------------------------------------------

A typical procedure for structure determination with AlphaFold models is:

::

  Analyze your data (xtriage for X-ray data or mtriage for cryo-EM)

  Identify whether most parts of most of your structure can be predicted or modeled

  Use Predict and build to automatically generate an interpretation of your data

Analyzing your data
-------------------

It is a good idea to evaluate your data to have an idea of its resolution 
and overall quality before working with it. You can use
`phenix.xtriage <xtriage.html>`_ to do this for X-ray data and
`phenix.mtriage <mtriage.html>`_ for cryo-EM data.
For X-ray data in particular you will need to know the space group of your
structure (or its enantiomer, as in P61 or P65).

Identify whether most parts of most of your structure can be predicted or modeled
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You might want to go ahead and predict models for all the chains in your
structure (even before getting the data) to get an idea of how much information
you are going to get from structure prediction. You can use
`phenix.predict_model <predict_model.html>`_
to do this for protein chains.  For nucleic acid chains, normally you are going
to have to either use an external procedure to predict their structures or to
build them separately (i.e., with 
`phenix.autobuild <autobuild.html>`_ .

In general terms, if most parts of most of the components of your structure can 
be predicted with high confidence (i.e., a value of the plDDT metric of  70
or higher), then predicted models are likely to be very useful.

Use Predict and build to automatically generate an interpretation of your data
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you have either cryo-EM or X-ray data with a resolution of about 4.5 A
or better, and if you have useful predicted models for most of the components
of your structure, you may be able to use Predict and build to
automatically generate an initial interpretation of your data.

The Predict and build procedure 
(`phenix.predict_and_build <predict_and_build.html>`_) just requires a
sequence file (one sequence for each chain in the model to be built) and
either X-ray data (an mtz file) or cryo-EM data (two half-maps).  This
procedure carries out iterative prediction and structure determination, yielding
a final rebuilt model as well as a final morphed model that contains the 
final set of predicted models.


Other procedures for using AlphaFold models in Phenix
-----------------------------------------------------


1. Get an AlphaFold model (or a model from the PDB) for each chain in your
structure.  You can use the `phenix.predict_model <predict_model.html>`_
method in the
Phenix GUI to do this using the Google Colab notebook system or the Phenix
server.

2. Trim a model and break into rigid domains.  You can use 
`phenix.process_predicted_model <process_predicted_model.html>`_ to do this.

3. Dock models (cryo-EM) or carry out molecular replacement 
(crystallography) to place your models in the right places in your map 
or unit cell. You can use 
`phenix.dock_predicted_model <dock_predicted_model.html>`_ (cryo-EM)
or `phenix.phaser <phaser_mr.html>`_ (crystallography) to do this.
  
4. Fill in missing parts of your models with loop fitting or iterative 
model-building.  You can do this 
with `phenix.rebuild_predicted_model <rebuild_predicted_model.html>`_
for cryo-EM and `phenix.autobuild <autobuild.html>`_ for crystallography.

5. Refine the rebuilt predicted models that you obtain.  You can use
`phenix.real_space_refine <real_space_refine.html>`_ for cryo-EM models and
`phenix.refine <refinement.html>`_ for crytstallographic models.

6. Examine your resulting model in detail, using the validation tools 
that are part of 
`phenix.real_space_refine <real_space_refine.html>`_  and
`phenix.refine <refinement.html>`_ 
to help you
identify problem areas and using manual model-building tools to fix them.


Advanced steps
--------------

Iteration of AlphaFold and model-building with experimental data
----------------------------------------------------------------

You may be able to improve your rebuilt AlphaFold model by iterating the
AlphaFold step and including your rebuilt model as a template (and skipping
any other templates).
This process is what the `phenix.predict_and_build <predict_and_build.html>`_
Phenix tool in the GUI does for you automatically.

Structures with multiple chains
-------------------------------

The `phenix.predict_and_build <predict_and_build.html>`_ tool can work with
a structure with multiple chains, but the
`phenix.dock_and_rebuild <dock_and_rebuild.html>`_ tool only works on one 
chain at a time.

For a cryo-EM structure, you can work with one chain at a time if you want.  
You can use the whole map for each chain, or if you have some idea of what chain
goes where, you can mask out or box the map so that it shows only one
chain and use that as your map.  Boxing or masking the map can speed up
the process and improve the result considerably.

Boxing maps before rebuilding
-----------------------------

For complex structures with many chains or with chains that contain domains
with long linkers, docking can be very complicated and take a long
time. In these cases it may be especially helpful to box or mask the map
if you can do that.  If you cannot, you might want to run the docking step
individually with each domain that you get from 
`phenix.process_predicted_model <process_predicted_model.html>`_ 
and then examine where they went in the map. If the domains seem to correspond
to different molecules, you might want to mask out the part of the density
that corresponds to the molecule you don't want to fit and re-try.  You can
also try running 
`phenix.dock_in_map <dock_in_map.html>`_ with one domain at a time and ask
to find multiple copies; then you can choose the one that matches up with
the other domains you have placed.

Background
----------

Structure prediction software is now capable of generating models that are
highly accurate over some or all parts of the models.  Importantly,
these predictions often come with reliable residue-by-residue estimates of
uncertainty.

Compact domains in these predicted models in which all
the residues have high confidence often will be very accurate over the
entire domains. However, separate domains that each have high confidence
but are connected by lower confidence residues sometimes have relative
positions and orientations that differ between predicted and
experimentally-determined structures.

When using predicted models as a starting point for experimental structure
determination, it can be helpful to:

::

    Remove low-confidence residues entirely

    Break up the model into domains and allow the domains to have
    different orientations

For a high-confidence predicted model, you might try using the predicted model
as-is first.  For most predicted models, you may want to try removing
low-confidence residues, then additionally try breaking the model into
domains and placing the domains one at a time.

An important feature of recent predicted models is that they generally have
very accurate sequence alignment.  That means that the assignment of the 
sequence to the high-confidence parts of the model is usually correct. This
can make a very big difference in completion of the remainder of the structure
(the parts that were not predicted with high confidence) because you know
exactly what residues go in the gaps.  This means that model-building of
the remainder of the structure can often be completed with loop-fitting
tools instead of trying to rebuild everything.

What do do after applying Phenix tools to predicted models
----------------------------------------------------------

While AlphaFold and other predicted models can be quite accurate overall, some
details in otherwise-accurate regions and some whole regions can be 
incompatible with your experimental data.  The Phenix procedures for
producing models based on your experimental data and using predicted models
as starting points are designed to try and keep the accurate parts of the
predicted models and to replace the inaccurate parts.  Depending on the
resolution of your data, the automatically-produced models may be quite
accurate or may themselves need a lot of trimming and rebuilding.

Once you have used Phenix tools to modify a predicted model based on
experimental data you will want to carefully analyze the resulting model,
comparing every detail to the experimental map or data.  You will 
generally want to use manual model-building tools such as Coot or Isolde
to fix small and large errors in the models that remain.

You can also iterate the AlphaFold prediction using your rebuilt model as
an input to a new round of AlphaFold
(See also the `documentation for running AlphaFold predictions 
<predict_model.html>`_).
