AlphaFold and Phenix
====================

You can use the predicted models from AlphaFold and other prediction
software in Phenix.  Using these models can be very helpful in structure
determination because the models can be very accurate over much of their
length and the models come with accuracy estimates that allow removal
of poorly-predicted regions.

General procedure for using AlphaFold models in Phenix
------------------------------------------------------

To use AlphaFold models in Phenix you can follow this overall procedure:


1. Get an AlphaFold model (or a model from the PDB) for each chain in your
structure.  You can use the "AlphaFold in Colab" button in the 
Phenix GUI to do this using the Google Colab notebook system.
(See also the `documentation for running AlphaFold <alphafold_in_colab.html>`_).

2. Trim the model and break into rigid domains.  You can use 
`phenix.process_predicted_model <process_predicted_model.html>`_ to do this.

3. Dock your models (cryo-EM) or carry out molecular replacement 
(crystallography) to place your models in the right places in your map 
or unit cell. You can use 
`phenix.dock_predicted_model <dock_predicted_model.html>`_ (cryo-EM)
or `phenix.phaser <phaser_mr.html>`_ (crystallography) to do this.
  
4. Fill in the missing parts of your models with loop fitting or iterative 
model-building.  You can do this 
with `phenix.rebuild_predicted_model <rebuild_predicted_model.html>`_
for cryo-EM and `phenix.autobuild <autobuild.html>`_ for crystallography.

5. Refine the rebuilt predicted models that you obtain.  You can use
`phenix.real_space_refine <real_space_refine.html>`_ for cryo-EM models and
`phenix.refine <refinement.html>`_ for crytstallographic models.

6. Examine your resulting model in detail, using the validation tools 
that are part of 
`phenix.real_space_refine <real_space_refine.html>`_  and
`phenix.refine <refinement.html>`_ 
to help you
identify problem areas and using manual model-building tools to fix them.


For a cryo-EM structure, you can carry out steps 2-4 in one step with
`phenix.dock_and_rebuild <dock_and_rebuild.html>`_. This just links the
processing, docking, and rebuilding steps together.


Background
----------

Structure prediction software is now capable of generating models that are
highly accurate over some or all parts of the models.  Importantly,
these predictions often come with reliable residue-by-residue estimates of
uncertainty.

Compact domains in these predicted models in which all
the residues have high confidence often will be very accurate over the
entire domains. However, separate domains that each have high confidence
but are connected by lower confidence residues sometimes have relative
positions and orientations that differ between predicted and
experimentally-determined structures.

When using predicted models as a starting point for experimental structure
determination, it can be helpful to:

::

    Remove low-confidence residues entirely

    Break up the model into domains and allow the domains to have
    different orientations

For a high-confidence predicted model, you might try using the predicted model
as-is first.  For most predicted models, you may want to try removing
low-confidence residues, then additionally try breaking the model into
domains and placing the domains one at a time.

An important feature of recent predicted models is that they generally have
very accurate sequence alignment.  That means that the assignment of the 
sequence to the high-confidence parts of the model is usually correct. This
can make a very big difference in completion of the remainder of the structure
(the parts that were not predicted with high confidence) because you know
exactly what residues go in the gaps.  This means that model-building of
the remainder of the structure can often be completed with loop-fitting
tools instead of trying to rebuild everything.

What do do after applying Phenix tools to predicted models
----------------------------------------------------------

While AlphaFold and other predicted models can be quite accurate overall, some
details in otherwise-accurate regions and some whole regions can be 
incompatible with your experimental data.  The Phenix procedures for
producing models based on your experimental data and using predicted models
as starting points are designed to try and keep the accurate parts of the
predicted models and to replace the inaccurate parts.  Depending on the
resolution of your data, the automatically-produced models may be quite
accurate or may themselves need a lot of trimming and rebuilding.

Once you have used Phenix tools to modify a predicted model based on
experimental data you will want to carefully analyze the resulting model,
comparing every detail to the experimental map or data.  You will 
generally want to use manual model-building tools such as Coot or Isolde
to fix small and large errors in the models that remain.
