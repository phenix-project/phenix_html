Purpose
-------

Create a composite model similar to a supplied model using fragments 
from the PDB.

This tool can be used in early stages of model-building to try and
improve parts of a preliminary model by replacing them with similar
fragments from a deposited structure.

Note that the composite model may not actually have good geometry because
the fragments from the PDB are morphed (distorted) to match the supplied
model and also because the junctions between fragments taken from the PDB
are not refined.

Usage
-----

replace_with_fragments_from_pdb can create composite models for protein chains

You can adjust the maximum number of insertions/deletions in each replacement
fragment and whether to morph structures obtained by SSM matching.  

You can supply a map file for refinement or calculation of map-model
correlations.

You can also choose to exclude or include specific PDB entries in SSM 
matching and fragment searching, or exclude all PDB entries with sequences 
similar to a particular PDB entry.

You can choose to create a replacement for just a selected part of your
model (by supplying a selection string that specifies what to select).


How replace_with_fragments_from_pdb works:
------------------------------------------

Search structures in the PDB (using SSM matching and fragment searching) for 
fragments similar to segments in a supplied model. Then choose the best
matching segments for each part of the supplied model and create a composite
model using the fragments from the PDB.

replace_with_fragments_from_pdb uses SSM-based (secondary structure matching)
to find structures in the PDB that are similar to a supplied model. The SSM 
matching is the same as in phenix.superpose_models.

replace_with_fragments_from_pdb also uses fragment searching to find shorter
fragments matching each loop (segment between two helices or strands)
in the supplied model.

The fragments obtained with fragment searching are always morphed (distorted)
to make the distance between starting and ending residues match the distance
in the supplied structure.

Fragments obtained from SSM matching are optionally morphed to match the
target structure as well. The distance over which morphing occurs (the
shift-field distance) is adjustable (typically 10 A), where structure is
largely preserved over shorter distances and may be changed over longer
distances.

The supplied model is then used as a template and matching parts of structures
from the PDB are superimposed on the template. The best-matching segments
(smallest rmsd and longest length) are chosen and connected.  Gaps are filled
if possible by a targeted fragment search of the PDB.


Examples
--------

Standard run of replace_with_fragments_from_pdb:
------------------------------------------------

Running replace_with_fragments_from_pdb is easy. From the command-line you can type:

::

    phenix.replace_with_fragments_from_pdb model.pdb nproc=8


This will find fragments in the PDB similar to model.pdb, put them together
and write out a new model using these fragments.

Possible Problems
-----------------

Specific limitations and problems:
----------------------------------

The final model may have poor geometry at connections between fragments, so
further refinement is normally required.  Additionally the final model may
have poor geometry within segments because morphing is carried out to
match the target structure.
