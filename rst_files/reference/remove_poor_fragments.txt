Purpose
-------

This routine takes a model that contains RNA and protein and tries to
identify fragments of protein that were accidentally built into RNA
density.

Usage
-----

When carrying out model-building for complexes between protein and RNA it 
sometimes happens that protein can be built accidentally into regions that 
are really RNA. The phenix.remove_poor_fragments tool is used to try and 
identify such incorrectly-built regions. 

How remove_poor_fragments works:
--------------------------------
The key idea in this approach is that these incorrectly-built regions tend 
to be isolated (not in the middle of a protein domain) and to have lower 
map-model correlation than the correct parts of the protein chains.  The 
phenix.remove_poor_fragments tool ranks all protein segments on these 
criteria and removes the worst ones. The threshold that is chosen based 
on the number of residues of RNA expected in the molecule that were not 
built, the fraction of protein that was built, and the quality of the 
model, using the formula:

residues_to_remove = A * protein_built * rna_not_built/(cc*protein_present)

where cc is the map-model correlation for the protein part of the model, 
protein_present is the number of protein residues in the sequence file, 
protein_built are residues of protein built, and rna_not_built are 
residues of RNA in the sequence file minus the number built.

The logic of this formula is that there is a certain volume, proportional 
to rna_not_built, that is really RNA that might be accidentally built as 
protein. Furthermore the logic is that the number of residues of protein 
that might be built in that volume is higher if more residues of protein 
have been built and higher if the model-map correlation for the protein 
model is low. These relationships were seen in an analysis of ribosome 
structures. A scale factor A of 0.53 relating the optimal number of 
residues to remove to the other factors was found empirically.
