Purpose
-------

The routine map_symmetry will identify the symmetry in a map and create a
file with the symmetry operations.

Usage
-----

How map_symmetry works:
-----------------------

Map-symmetry uses the density at a set of randomly-chosen points in a map
to identify the symmetry in a map from a set of pre-defined symmetry types that
include point-group symmetry as well as helical symmetry.  For each possible
symmetry, the correlation of values at symmetry-related points is calculated.
The score for the symmetry type is the square root of the number of elements 
in the symmetry multiplied by the map correlation for that symmetry.

Map-symmetry assumes that the principal axes of symmetry in a map are along
x, y, or z, and that helical symmetry is helical along z.  The software
has a database of 45 common symmetry elements and point groups, along with
alternative settings of some of these. The user can specify a specific symmetry
type to examine (e.g., I for icosahedral or D7 for a 7-fold axis along z
perpendicular to a 2-fold axis along x or along y), or all elements in the
database can be examined.

For helical symmetry, a Fourier transform of the density is examined along the
c* axis to find periodicity along z likely to correspond to the helical 
translation.  These likely translations (and integer fractions of them) are 
tested along with possible rotations to check for helical symmetry.


Examples
--------

Standard run of map_symmetry:
-----------------------------

Running map_symmetry is easy. From the command-line you can type:

::

    phenix.map_symmetry emd_8750.map symmetry=D7

where emd_8750.map is a map (CCP4, mrc or other related format), and in
this case you are specifying that only D7 symmetry should be considered.


Possible Problems
-----------------

Specific limitations and problems:
----------------------------------

Map-symmetry assumes that the principal symmetry axes are along the x, y,
and z-axes of the map (or half-way between in some cases).  If the symmetry
in your map is arbitrarily oriented then this procedure will not work.

Helical symmetry is assumed to be along the z-axis.
