Purpose
-------

The emplace_local tool docks the input model within a sphere of density centered on
a defined point in the half-maps, returning the docked model, a local weighted map,
and quality of fit statistics.

How emplace_local works
-----------------------

The chosen region of density is analysed for local signal and noise (both of
which are resolution and direction-dependent) to define a likelihood target for
rotation and translation searches, followed by rigid-body refinement. The quality
of fit can be judged by three factors:
1) whether there is a unique solution;
2) the log-likelihood-gain (LLG) score, which should preferably be greater than 60;
3) the map correlation coefficient to the weighted map used for docking.

The basic inputs are:

::

  model file
  two unmasked half-map files
  nominal resolution
  specification of center of search region

Note that the search center can be specified explicitly with the sphere_center
keyword (the usual approach) or by translating the search model to the desired
search region and not providing a sphere_center keyword.
