phenix.reduce: tool for adding hydrogens to a PDB model
=======================================================

**Purpose**

phenix.reduce is a command line tool for adding hydrogens to a PDB
structure file. Hydrogens are added in standardized geometry with optimization
of the orientations of OH, SH, NH3+, Met methyls, Asn and Gln sidechain amides,
and His rings. Both proteins and nucleic acids can be processed. HET groups can
also be processed as long as the atom connectivity is provided. The program is
described in `Word, et al.(1999). J. Mol. Biol. 285, 1735-1747
<https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283698924019>`_. For more

**How to run**

phenix.reduce is run from the command line::

  % phenix.reduce [pdb_file] [options]

**To get information about command line options type**::

  % phenix.reduce

or for a longer list::

  % phenix.reduce -h

**Hydrogens in refinement**

Please refer to phenix.refine documentation to see how hydrogen atoms are used
in structure refinement.
