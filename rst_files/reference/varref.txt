phenix.varref: a tool for refinement a model against multiple maps
==================================================================

.. contents::

Description
-----------

phenix.varref stands for 'variability refinement'. The program refines a model 
into an ensemble of maps derived from cryo-EM. The ensemble of maps represents 
the sample's heterogenicity captured during the experiement. The result of 
refinement with phenix.varref is an ensemble of real-space refined models that 
adequately represent the ensemble of input maps. For more details refer to:
http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbamem.2023.184133.

Availability
------------

The program is availalble in the command line and in the GUI.

IMPORTANT: any problem report should be sent after trying the latest
nightly build of Phenix::

  https://www.phenix-online.org/download/nightly_builds.cgi

Bug or problem reports should include at least 1) all input files used to run
the program, 2) list of parameters that were customized, 3) error message and 4)
a brief description of steps that lead to the problem. Please use file sharing 
tools (such as Dropbox, Google Drive, etc) to send large files.

Command line examples
---------------------

  1) A typical run::

       phenix.varref model.pdb map1.mrc map2.mrc... mapN.mrc resolution=4.2 nproc=10

     The program takes one model and list of maps in any order. The resolution 
     is a mandatory parameter. nproc specifies the number of processors 
     available to the program to use. A run using a single processor can take a 
     very long time! Use as many CPU as possible!

  2) The model contains an unknown to Phenix ligand::

       phenix.varref model.pdb ligand.cif map1.mrc map2.mrc... mapN.mrc \
       resolution=4.2 nproc=10
       
     The ligand dictionary CIF file can be obtained using ReadySet! or eLBOW 
     programs of Phenix and supplied to phenix.varref as an additional file.
     
  3) Anchoring solvent, ligands and other small molecules to the macromolecule::
  
      phenix.varref model.pdb map1.mrc map2.mrc... mapN.mrc resolution=4.2 
        nproc=10 parameters.eff
        
     phenix.varref uses a rather aggressive refinement technieques such as 
     morphing, simulated annealing and perturbing initial model by means of MD.
     This means that small molecule (non-macromolecules) entities of the model
     may drift away from their original position or binding sites. To prevent 
     this from heppening they can be anchored to the macromolecule using custom
     bonds (as well as angles and so on). Refer to phenix.refine documentation
     for more details. In the example above this is done by providing a parameter
     file containing the following lines::
     
       geometry_restraints {
         edits {
           bond {
             atom_selection_1 = chain B and resseq 87 and name N
             atom_selection_2 = chain S and resseq 1 and resname HOH and name O
             distance_ideal = 2.0
             sigma = 0.01
           }
         }
       }
     
     Here the water oxygen in chain S (residue number 1) is linked to the 
     Nitrogen of residue 87 in chain B with the bond length of 2A. Any number of 
     bonds can be specified.
     
Notes
-----
  - The program can use multiple CPU. The program does not use GPU. Running on
    single processor can be very slow. Use as many CPUs as possible.
