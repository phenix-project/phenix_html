Purpose
-------

The purpose of AQuaRef is to refine atomic model coordinates using geometric
restraints derived from AI-accelerated quantum-mechanical calculations. 
Real- and reciprocal-space refinements are supported using crystallographic or 
cryo-EM experimental data.

Expectations
------------

Atomic models resulting from AQuaRef refinement are expected to have improved 
geometry, as evaluated by standard validation tools such as MolProbity, Rama-Z, 
and hydrogen bond skew-kurtosis plots. They should also maintain a similar or 
improved fit to the experimental data compared to standard classic refinement.

Requirements and Current Limitations
------------------------------------

Protein-only (plus water) models are supported at the moment. Static disorder 
(i.e., alternative conformations) is not supported, except for exchangeable H/D
sites in case of refinement against neutron diffraction data.

If a model contains unsupported entity (e.g., a metal ion) or alternative 
conformations, it is still possible to refine it but unsupporte entities need to
be excluded using 'exclude' keyword, as shown below in Examples.

The atomic model needs to be nearly final (in the later stages of standard 
classic refinement) and atom-complete (e.g., all hydrogen atoms are present 
explicitly, no missing side chains). The model is also expected to have 
meaningful geometry, such as being devoid of overlapping (clashing) atoms or 
severely distorted covalent bonds.

Hardware: While this can possibly work on both CPU and GPU computers, currently 
available builds are specific to Linux machines with CUDA 11 or 12. Additionally, 
runtimes on CPU-based computers are expected to be much slower compared to GPUs.

No GUI: Command line only.

Availability
------------

AQuaRef is available as part of Phenix or separately from Phenix as part of 
Q|R refinement project (www.qrefine.com or https://github.com/qrefine/qrefine).

Examples
--------

A self-consistent, quck to run, simple example is distributed with the software 
(Phenix, Q|R) and located in phenix/modules/qrefine/examples/AQuaRef folder.
Check README file for details. If using AQuaRef for the first time, we suggest
to run this example first in order to make sure all works as expected.
