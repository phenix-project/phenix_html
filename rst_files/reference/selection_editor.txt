Using the Selection Editor
==========================

.. contents::

Overview
--------

The selection editor is a uniform interface for graphically selecting groups of atoms. The
editor generates the `syntax <atom_selections.html>`_ that Phenix uses for atom selections
and is a more advanced interface than the "View/Pick" button next to certain fields in
the GUI. This interface is used to define

- Secondary structure annotations (helices, beta sheets, etc.)
- NCS groups
- TLS groups
- Refinement strategy options (occupancies, rigid bodies, etc.)
- Custom geometry restraints (bonds, angles, dihedrals, etc.)

Moreover, selections made in this editor can be saved as a file ("Export" button) and reloaded
at a later time ("Load" button). It is important to note that selection files saved from one
Phenix program GUI (e.g. phenix.refine) generally cannot be used with another Phenix program
GUI (e.g. phenix.real_space_refine) because the organization for the parameters can be
slightly different among the programs.

The "Validate Syntax" button can be used to check if the selections are valid for the given
model. This only checks for syntactical correctness. This does not check if the selections
are physically sensible or if there are overlapping/duplicated selections.

The "Sequence" button opens a new window showing the sequence for the given model and any
secondary structure annotations for helices and beta sheets.

The "Model" button opens a new window for graphically selecting atoms.

It is important to note that selections can only be made for options that have been enabled
in the Phenix program GUI. That is, if the "Use NCS" box is not checked in the phenix.refine
GUI, there will be no panel for selecting NCS groups in the selection editor. Changing options
in the Phenix program GUI will dynamically update the available panels in the selection editor.
If selections were made for an option and that option is later disabled, those selections will
not be passed to the Phenix program when the selection editor is closed.

Closing the selection editor will update the Phenix program GUI with the selections. This is
required before running the program.

Basic Usage
------------

The selection editor can generate two basic types of selections

- Groups composed of one selection (e.g. helix or rigid body)

.. image:: ../images/selection_editor_helix.png

- Groups composed of multiple selections (e.g. beta sheet or NCS group)

.. image:: ../images/selection_editor_sheet.png

For both types, the general procedure for adding a new group is to click on the "Add ..."
button (e.g."Add Sheet"). This generates a new row and the selection can be directly typed
in the row by double-clicking the appropriate column field. For the second type, you can add
additional selections to the group (e.g. "Add Strand") by entering selections in the new row.
Some selections have additional columns and they can be changed by double-clicking the
appropriate column field and typing in the value. To expand or collapse the multiple selections
within an group, you can click on the "Expand All" or "Collapse All" buttons, respectively. Some
times, it is more sensible to toggle through a series of choices for a parameter (e.g. "Sense"
for beta strands) and double-clicking that field will do that instead.

Deleting groups behaves similarly to adding groups. Multiple groups can be deleted at the same
time by shift-clicking the range of groups or alt-clicking (command-clicking on macOS) a
non-contiguous set. For the second type, be careful when deleting an entire group. That option
is available if any selection within the group is highlighted. That is, an entire beta sheet
can be deleted by clicking "Delete Sheet" when any strand within that sheet is highlighted.

Some options are shown in the left panel under "Other settings." These are usually options
where it is sensible to apply them to many groups. After several groups are selected, either
by shift-clicking a range or alt-clicking (command-clicking on macOS), changing a value in
"Other settings" will update all the selected groups. If a parameter in "Other settings" is
also shown as a column field, the selection editor will update that column to the new value
for the selected groups.

An automatic detection option is available for

- Secondary structure annotations
- NCS groups
- TLS groups

by clicking the "Find ..." button in the left panel. If there are options for tweaking the
automatic detection algorithm, they will show up in a new dialog window. These can be changed
before running the algorithm. When automatic detection is finished, the selection editor
will replace any existing selections with the automatically detected ones. Also, the automatic
selections will be saved in your project directory.

Graphical Selection
-------------------

In addition to manually typing in selections with the proper syntax, selections can also be
made with the model viewer by clicking on "Model" in the top toolbar.

.. image:: ../images/selection_editor_model.png

The model viewer will display the currently highlighted selections in the current panel in
the selection editor. In order to use the model viewer to edit a selection

1) Highlight the desired selection for editing in the selection editor
2) Click on "Edit Selection"" in the model viewer
3) Make the changes in the model viewer
4) In the model viewer, Click "Accept" to keep the changes, "Discard" to keep the original

Clicking atoms in the model viewer will toggle the highlight on them. To change between
highlighting the entire residue or individual atoms, pick the appropriate option in the
"Select" field.

The "Show" option in "View Controls" can toggle between showing all the atoms or just the
backbone. This can simplify selecting residues.

When editing groups that have multiple selections in the same row (e.g. "Base Pairs" or
"Stacking Pairs" under "Secondary Structure"), the specific selection can be changed by
the "Field" widget in the model viewer.

A range of residues can be selected or deselected by shift-clicking or alt-clicking
(option-clicking on macOS), respectively. The model viewer remembers the last residue that
was clicked and uses that as the first residue in the range.

Known Issues
------------

- Graphically making selections can expand the selection syntax into an all-atom selection
- With the model viewer open, highlighting many selections may be slow; close
  the model viewer for faster performance when highlighting many selections
- When an invalid type is entered (e.g. a letter is provided when the field
  expects a number), the selection editor will complain one more time after a
  valid type is entered.
- After clicking "Validate Syntax", the currently selected or most recently
  selected rows may not be highlighted in red if the syntax is incorrect.
- On macOS, the text in editing mode can be slightly offset in the row
