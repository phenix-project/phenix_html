Purpose
-------

Map correlations is a GUI and command-line tool for evaluating the fit of
models to maps and the correlation between maps.  It has the feature that
the model or second map can be offset (translated) to maximize the 
correlation.  This offset can be restricted to shifts allowed by
space-group symmetry (translational_offsets=Allowed_by_symmetry)  or it 
can be any shifts (translational_offsets=Any).

Maps can be supplied as map files or as map coefficients. Maps and 
map coefficients may not be both used at the same time.

If a model is supplied, the local correlation for each residue is calculated

The total number of files supplied must be exactly two.  

Usage

How map_correlations works:
----------------------------

If an optimized translation is requested, map correlations finds the
optimal translation using RESOLVE.  The translation is calculated
based on an FFT-based correlation search.
If two maps (or map coefficients files) are supplied, the second map is
shifted. If a model is supplied, a model-based map is calculated, and the
optimal translation for that model-based map is applied to the model

If you supply a model file, by default model density is calculated 
using the atom types, occupancies and isotropic thermal factors 
(B-values) supplied in that PDB file. 

If you specify b_values=Zero then
all the B-values are set to zero before calculation of correlations. This
is useful if you want to compare the clarities of a series of maps, all
representing the same model. You calculate the map-model correlation of
each map to your reference model in which all B-values in the reference
model have been set to zero (Terwilliger et al., 2018):

Output files from map_correlations
-----------------------------------

**xxx_offset.pdb**: A PDB file offset to match the origin in the mtz file.
Produced if translational_offsets are requested and a model is supplied.
**xxx_offset.mtz**: A translated version of the second MTZ file supplied 
(if any),
offset so that the map calculated from it optimally matches the map from the
first MTZ file.
**xxx_offset.ccp4**: A translated version of the second map file supplied,
(if any) offset so that the map calculated from it optimally matches the map from the
first map file.
