Generating a polder map
===============================

.. contents::

Overview
--------

A polder map is an omit map which excludes the bulk solvent around the 
omitted region. This way, weak densities, which can be obscured by bulk
solvent, may become visible. Typical omitted regions are:

  - ligands
  - residues protruding into solvent area and with unclear side chain 
    orientations (such as lysine, arginine, etc.)
  - C- or N-terminal residues
  

It is not recommended to omit large portions of the model at once (as 
the excluded bulk solvent volume might become too large) or to omit 
single atoms. Instead: several residues or one ligand are typical 
selections for polder maps. It should be kept in mind that ``phenix.polder`` 
does map calculations, no bias-removal strategies (such as refinement, 
annealing, etc.) are applied. 

A presentation file with examples can be found `here 
<https://www.phenix-online.org/presentations/phenix_polder.pdf>`_.


Running the program
-------------------

``phenix.polder`` is executed via the command line::

  % phenix.polder model.pdb data.mtz selection='chain B and resseq 3'

This command calculates an omit map of residue 3 in chain B. Common file 
formats are supported (.pdb and .cif for models; .mtz, .hkl files for data). 
The syntax for the `selections <atom_selections.html>`_ is the same as used 
by other phenix tools.

Output of ``phenix.polder`` consists of a single MTZ file, named 
``polder_map_coeffs.mtz`` by default. This file will contain amplitudes and phases 
for two maps:

  - **mFo-DFc_polder:** map coefficients of polder omit map
  - **mFo-DFc_omit:** map coefficients for omit map where bulk solvent floods into 
    omitted region. It is equivalent to remove the selection from the model and 
    to calculate a difference map. This map can be used for comparison with the 
    polder map. 

Both map types require you to load them manually in Coot, by choosing the "Open
MTZ, mmCIF, fcf or phs..." option and by activating the "Is a Difference Map" 
option in the window which opens after choosing the filename.


Other options
-------------

There are several other programs in Phenix for calculating omit maps. 

  - `phenix.composite_omit_map <composite_omit_map.html>`_ can produce 
    relatively bias-free maps by computing a number of omit maps covering 
    specific regions, and then combining the areas around the omitted regions. 
    Default options allows the bulk solvent mask to extend into the omitted 
    region
  - `phenix.refine <refinement.html>`_ can be used to manually generate omit
    maps for a smaller selection of the model by specifying the
    ``omit_selection`` keyword.  The single-omit mode of the composite omit
    map program is equivalent to this.
  - `phenix.maps <maps.html>`_ can generate simple omit maps without refinement.
