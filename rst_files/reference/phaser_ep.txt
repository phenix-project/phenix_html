SAD and MR-SAD phasing with the Phaser GUI
==========================================

.. contents::

Introduction
------------

Since the two Phaser GUIs use a common base, much of the experimental phasing
interface is similar to the `Phaser-MR GUI <phaser_mr.html>`_.  This section
only covers features unique to SAD phasing, including instructions for MR-SAD.

Phaser is used internally in the AutoSol wizard, which automates a complete
experimental phasing pipeline including heavy atom search, phasing, density
modification, and preliminary model-building.  (It is also capable of running
MR-SAD experiments.)  For that reason, we recommend trying AutoSol first,
and falling back to standalone Phaser for more difficult problems where finer
control over parameters is required.

This document only covers configuration of the Phaser GUI; for a detailed
explanation of the various terms and search procedures referenced here as well
as interpretation of results, consult the
documentation for `AutoSol <autosol.html>`_ or `Phaser <phaser.html>`_, or the
`Phaser WIKI <http://www.phaser.cimr.cam.ac.uk/index.php/Phaser_Crystallographic_Software>`_.

Input files and mandatory parameters
------------------------------------

Phaser requires a reflections file (any format) containing anomalous data, and
(for normal SAD mode) a file containing heavy atom sites, in either PDB or
SHELX format. Either the wavelength or the energy used is also required.  If
you are using normal SAD mode, you may choose whether to use the given
enantiomer ("hand") of the heavy-atom sites or the inverse or both.

To run an MR-SAD experiment, change the mode to "MR-SAD phasing", and enter a
partial model (PDB file) and the expected variance from the actual structure
(RMSD or percent identity).  In MR-SAD, the chirality of the partial model
restricts the sites to the given enantiomer.  You could optionally provide a
file containing heavy atom sites, but these are normally found by
log-likelihood-gradient completion from the partial model; an advantage is
that these sites are guaranteed to correspond to the same hand and origin as
the partial model.  Instead of a partial model specified with atoms, you can
optionally provide an electron density map instead, by choosing "map" from
the "Partial model type" pulldown.

The input for ASU contents is identical to the `Phaser-MR GUI <phaser_mr.html>`_.
Heavy atoms may be either standard elements from the periodic table, or
cluster compounds such as tantalum bromide or tungsten clusters.

Output
------

Depending on the choice of hand, Phaser will output one or two sets of files
containing the heavy atom sites (PDB format) and phased reflections (MTZ),
including map coefficients and Hendrickson-Lattman phase probability
distributions (useful for refining with experimental phase restraints).  This
map is usually very noisy and difficult to interpret, and typically requires
density modification to become useful.

Frequently Asked Questions
--------------------------

  - **How do I tell Phaser to look for more anomalous scatterers?**
    Click on the "Composition and sites" tab.  A control at the bottom labeled
    "Enable substructure completion by log-likelihood gradient maps" turns on
    this feature (and is already on by default).  However, Phaser also needs to
    be told what type of scatterers to look for.  These can be entered into
    the "Scattering types" box either manually or by clicking the "Select
    scatterer type" button.  You may enter as many of these as you think are
    present and ordered in your crystal - note however that at the wavelengths
    commonly used for macromolecular crystallography, some atom types may
    be difficult to distinguish (such as sulfur and chlorine).

  - **How do I phase a structure with tantalum bromide clusters in Phenix?**
    This is possible, but not really optimal at present.  Phaser has built-in
    support for Ta6Br12 clusters, which have the scatterer type "TX".  These
    are represented as spherically-averaged scatterers, which are a better
    representation than conventional atoms but not as good as an oriented
    atomic model of the actual cluster.  The output sites are represented as
    single TX pseudo-atoms.
