Purpose
-------

Try to complete a model by extracting all the secondary structure elements
(helices and strands), rearranging and reconnecting them into a new model.

How Model Completion works:
---------------------------

Model completion is based on the idea that the helices and strands in 
protein model are generally correct, while the loops connecting them may be
inaccurate or even connect the wrong helices and strands.

Model completion first identifies secondary structure in a model. Then it
examines all the loops connecting these helices and strands in the model
and keeps the best-fitting and most plausible loops intact.  All the other loops
are removed from the model, resulting in a set of fragments representing part
of the structure.  The sequence assignments and connectivities of these 
fragments are then removed so that any fragment can potentially be connected
to any other fragment.

The core step in model completion is identification of all plausible connections
between ends of fragments in this partial model.  Connections that were present
in the supplied model are considered in this step along with potential
connections that are found by tracing from one fragment to another through high
density in the density map. Each possible connection is scored based on 
a set of criteria including (1) the lowest density at or between main-chain 
atom positions, (2) the maximum difference in density between adjacent
main-chain atom positions and (3) length of the connection (and other criteria
as well).

All possible arrangements of the available fragments and connections that
use all the availble fragments (in either forward or reverse directions) are
then considered using an iterative connection algorithm. Pairs
of fragments are listed, then all pairs of pairs (triples). Then larger
groupings are assembled using the higher scoring sets of smaller groupings
(typically the top half are considered at each stage), until a set of
potential complete chains are obtained.  At this stage a chain is a CA-only
model.  All the CA-only models are then converted to full chains using
PULCHRA (Rotkiewicz & Skolnick 2008) followed by adding side-chains
with phenix.sequence_from_map.

The potential complete chains obtained typically have many duplicate parts but
differ in connectivity.  Complete chains are scored in manner similar to
that used above for fragments, with an additional contribution to the
score based on the match between the supplied sequence and side-chain 
density along a chain.

The highest-scoring complete chains are then optimized by recombination among
these chains followed by real-space refinement.  The optimized chains are
rescored and the top resulting chains are provided.

Examples
--------

Standard run of model_completion:
------------------------------------

Running model_completion is easy. From the command-line you can type:

::

    phenix.model_completion my_model.pdb my_map.mrc resolution=3 nproc=8


This will attempt to complete my_model.pdb based on the map my_map.mrc at 
a resolution of 3 A using 8 processors.
