Introduction
============

Quantum Mechanics (QM) has been shown to provide accurate geometries and
energies for a wide range of chemical entities. Using QM for restraints
generation is not new, however, using QM *in situ* restraints generation
directly in *phenix.refine* without additional (and possibibly costly licensed)
software is new. The inclusion of MOPAC_ in the python3
installations of Phenix has made this possible. The Quantum Interface (QI) is
a new module that allows the use of MOPAC or a 3rd party QM package – Orca_ –
for a number of procedures.

Various uses
=====================

Calculate ligand restraints *in situ* using `Quantum Mechanical Restraints
(QMR) <quantum_mechanical_restraints.html>`_

Calculate ligand strain energies using `Quantum Mechanical Energies (QME)
<qi_energies.html>`_

Determination of best Histidine tautamer `Quantum Mechanical Flipping (QMF)
<qi_histidine.html>`_

Tips and Tricks
===============

Model completeness
------------------

One of the most important points about Quantum Chemistry is that it is an
all-electron_ method. This means that **all** atoms (and electrons) need to
be specified in order to perform the correct calculation. This is a case where
GIGO_ will really bite you. In standard refinement, missing atoms are not
critical but in QM missing atoms are catastrophic.

The QI module
calculates the charge based on the atoms in the input model (and the
selection) but care must be taken to ensure that the input model is correct
down to the protonation. Besides calculating the incorrect result, the QM
calculation can have difficulty converging thus resulting in excessive run
times.

Timings
-------

QM calculations scale as a power of the number of atoms. This means that
increasing the buffer can greatly affect the timings.

Using the parallel features in MOPAC and Orca are generally not linear so
the QI module has a feature to prefer simple parallelism on based on jobs
that can be useful for some situations.
