Purpose
-------

The routine segment\_and\_split\_map will identify the asymmetric
unit of a map (typically cryo-EM) and contiguous regions of density
within the asymmetric unit of the map.

Usage
-----

How segment\_and\_split\_map works:
-----------------------------------

If you have a CCP4-style (mrc, etc) map and a sequence file, 
you can use segment\_and\_split\_map to split the map into smaller pieces 
suitable for model-building or viewing.
The tool segment\_and\_split\_map will will find where your 
molecule is in the map and cut out and work with just that part of the density.
If your map has been averaged based on NCS symmetry and 
you supply a file with that NCS information (.ncs_spec, biomtr.dat, etc),
segment\_and\_split\_map will find the asymmetric unit of NCS and work
with that.

Finally, the segment\_and\_split\_map tool will cut the density 
in the asymmetic unit of your map into small pieces of connected density and 
write out a map for each one.

All the maps that are written by segment\_and\_split\_map are superimposable
on each other. They typically are all shifted from the original map to place
the origin of the maps on the grid point (0,0,0).

*Output files from segment\_and\_split\_map*
--------------------------------------------

**shifted\_map.ccp4**: Original map, shifted to place the origin on grid point (0,0,)

**shifted\_ncs.ncs_spec**: NCS operators (if any), shifted to match shifted\_map.ccp4.

**shifted\_pdb.pdb**: Input PDB file (if any), shifted to match shifted\_map.ccp4.

**box\_map\_au.ccp4**: Same as shifted\_map.ccp4, except that everything except the asymmetric unit of NCS is zeroed out (map shows the asymmetric unit only).

**box\_mask\_au.ccp4**: Mask showing location of NCS asymmetric unit. Superimposes on box\_map\_au.ccp4 and shifted\_map.ccp4.

**segment\_and\_split\_map\_info.pkl**: Pickled file with information about the segmentation. Used in phenix.map\_to\_model and to restore a shifted PDB file to original location.


*Shifting the map to the origin*
--------------------------------

Most crystallographic maps have the origin at the corner of the map (
grid point [0,0,0]), while most cryo-EM maps have the orgin in the 
middle of the map.  To make a consistent map, any maps with an origin not 
at the corner are shifted to put the origin at grid point [0,0,0]. This map
is the shifted map that is used for further steps in model-building.
At the conclusion of model-building, the model is shifted back to 
superimpose on the original map.

*Finding the region containing the molecule*
--------------------------------------------

By default (density\_select=True), the region of the map containing density
is cut out of the entire map. This is particularly useful if the original map
is very large and the molecule only takes up a small part of the map.  This
portion of the map is then shifted to place the origin at grid point [0,0,0].
(At the conclusion of model-building, the final model is shifted back to 
superimpose on the original map.)  The region containing density is chosen
as a box containing all the points above a threshold, typically 5% of the
maximum in the map.


*Finding the NCS asymmetric unit of the map*
--------------------------------------------

If you supply NCS matrices describing the NCS used to average the map (if any),
then segment\_and\_split\_map will try to define a region of the map that represents
the NCS asymmetric unit.  Application of the NCS operators to the NCS 
asymmetric unit will generate the entire map, and application to a model built
into the asymmetric unit will generate the entire model.  Normally
identification of the NCS asymmetric unit and segmentation of the map (below)
are done as a single step, yielding an asymmetric unit and a set of
contiguous regions of density within that asymmetric unit. The asymmetric unit
of NCS will be written out as a map to the segmentation\_dir directory,
superimposed on the shifted map (so that they can be viewed together in Coot).

*Segmentation of the map*
-------------------------

By default (segment=True) the map or NCS asymmetric unit of the map will
be segmented (cut into small pieces) into regions of connected density. This
is done by choosing a threshold of density and identifying contiguous regions
where all grid points are above this threshold. The threshold is chosen to
yield regions that have a size corresponding to about 50 residues.  The
regions of density are written out to the segmentation\_dir directory
and are superimposed on the shifted map (if you load the shifted map in 
Coot and a region map in Coot, they should superimpose.) 


Examples
--------

Standard run of segment\_and\_split\_map:
-----------------------------------------

Running segment\_and\_split\_map is easy. From the command-line you can type:

::

    phenix.segment\_and\_split\_map my_map.map seq.fa ncs_file=find_ncs.ncs_spec

where my_map.map is a CCP4, mrc or other related map format, seq.fa is a
sequence file, and find_ncs.ncs_spec is an optional file specifying any
NCS operators used in averaging the map. This can be in the form of
BIOMTR records from a PDB file as well.
