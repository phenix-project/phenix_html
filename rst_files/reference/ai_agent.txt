Purpose
-------

The Phenix AI agent will carry out an automated analysis of your X-ray or
cryo-EM data. Its purpose is to help beginners see how to run Phenix tools,
and to help experienced users to quickly evaluate their data and standard
approaches to structure determination.
The AI analysis tool can be accessed in the Phenix GUI.

How the AI Agent works
----------------------

The AI Agent expects to be given data files from crystallography (mtz files)
or from cryo-EM (mrc or ccp4 maps), a sequence file, and optional model files
or ligand files.  You can tell it what files to use by specifying a directory
containing the files or by loading the files in the AI Agent GUI window.

The AI Agent also accepts instructions like "first run xtriage and then 
molecular replacement", or "solve the structure", 
or "use 1 macro-cycle in phenix refine" or whatever else you want
to tell it to do with your X-ray or cryo-EM data.
You can supply those directions in the GUI. 
If your directory contains a README file it can read that file 
and do (more or less) what it says.

The AI Agent is supplied with a number of standard structure solution
pathways. It will try to fit your data into one of these, guided additionally
by any instructions you supply.  A typical pathway for X-ray data, for
example, might be xtriage -> autosol -> autobuild if the data are found to
have an anomalous signal in xtriage, or xtriage -> predict_and_build -> refine
if they do not.  For cryo-EM data, a typical pathway might be
mtriage -> resolve_cryo_em -> dock_in_map -> real_space_refine.  If you 
supply a ligand the pathways would end up with fitting the ligand and
refining the model with the ligand.  

You can modify most aspects of the structure solution pathways with your
instructions, as long as the necessary data is available.

When you run the agent in the GUI, it will load all the successful runs in
the normal way, so you have a complete record of what was done and so you
can restore any of the runs that it made for you.

This type of AI does not save or learn from your questions.  However the 
information in your log file is sent to the Phenix server, and from there,
on to Google gemini and OpenAI.


What to do with the AI analysis
-------------------------------

The purpose of the AI Agent is to help you interpret your data and to
suggest ways to analyze it. The agent will also suggest next steps.
You should keep in mind that these tools
can make mistakes and give you incorrect interpretations and poor suggestions
at times, so you want to just take the information as suggestions to think
about.

You can combine this AI analysis with the Phenix 
`chatbot <https://phenix-online.org/chatbot>`__ .  The chatbot can give
you interactive answers to your questions using the same database of information
as the AI analysis. This allows you to follow up on the AI analysis with
questions to the chatbot. You can also paste part of the output from the
AI analysis into the chatbot along with a question to get more context.
 
Limitations of the AI Agent
---------------------------

The AI analysis is limited to the sources that is supplied with, so it only
knows about Phenix, and it only knows what is in the documentation, the
videos and newsletters, and the papers we have supplied. 

AI tools like this one can also just make mistakes and give incorrect
answers. This does not seem to happen too often with this tool, but
you need to always be on alert when using it.  Use the tool as a helper,
don't expect it to always be right.

If a detail is missing in the documentation, the AI may not know about it.

Privacy in the AI Agent
-----------------------

If you use the AI Agent tool, your log files are sent to the Phenix server,
and from there on to OpenAI and Gemini.  That means the data 
could potentially
be used by OpenAI, and Google in any way that they use other 
AI data that is sent to them.

Note that access to OpenAI and Gemini is non-commerical only.

Running with Google, Ollama, or OpenAI
--------------------------------------

Normally you will use Google (gemini) as the AI LLM for your AI agent.  This
requires an API key for google (supplied with Phenix).  You can also use Ollama,
which is run on the Phenix server, or OpenAI, which also uses a supplied 
API key.  You can run AI analyses with Google or OpenAI without 
getting your own key, as a shared set
of keys is supplied. The number of analyses with these shared keys
is limited, however.
