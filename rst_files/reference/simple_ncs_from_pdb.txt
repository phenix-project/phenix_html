Purpose
-------

The simple\_ncs\_from\_pdb method identifies NCS in the chains in a PDB
file and writes out the NCS operators in forms suitable for
phenix.refine, resolve, and the AutoSol and AutoBuild Wizards.

Usage
-----

How simple\_ncs\_from\_pdb works:
---------------------------------

The basic steps that the simple\_ncs\_from\_pdb carries out are:

-  (1) Identify sets of chains in the PDB file that have the same
   sequences. These are potential NCS-related chains.

-  (2) Determine which chains in a group actually are related by NCS
   within a given tolerance (max\_rmsd, typically 2 A)

-  (3) Determine which residues in each chain are related by NCS, and
   break the chains into domains that do follow NCS if necessary.

-  (4) Determine the NCS operators for all chains in each NCS group or
   domain

Additional notes on how simple\_ncs\_from\_pdb works:
-----------------------------------------------------

The matching of chains is done in a first quick pass by calling
simple\_ncs\_from\_pdb recursively and only using every 10th residue in
the analysis. This allows a check of whether chains that have the same
sequence really have the same structure or whether some such chains
should be in separate NCS groups. The use of only every 10th residue
allows time for an all-against all matching of chains.

If residue numbers are not the same for corresponding chains, but they
are simply offset by a constant for each chain, this will be recognized
and the chains will be aligned.

An assumption in simple\_ncs\_from\_pdb is that residue numbers are
consistent among chains. They do not have to be the same: chain A can be
residues 1-100 and chain B 211-300. However chain A cannot be residues
1-10 and 20-50, matching to chain B residues 1-10 and 21-51.

Residue numbers are used to align pairs of chains, maximizing identities
of matching pairs of residues. Pairs of chains that can match are
identified.

Groupings of chains are chosen that maximize the number of matching
residues between each member of a group and the first (reference) member
of the group.

For a pair of chains, some segments may match and others not. Each pair
of segments must have a length at least as long as min\_length and a
percent identity at least as high as min\_percent. A pair of segments
may not end in a mismatch. An overall pair of chains must have an rmsd
of CA atoms of less than or equal to rmsd\_max.

If find\_invariant\_domain is specified then once all chains that can be
matched with the above algorithm are identified, all remaining chains
are matched, allowing the break-up of chains into invariant domains. The
invariant domains each get a separate NCS group.

*Output files from simple\_ncs\_from\_pdb*
------------------------------------------

The output files that are produced are:

-  NCS operators written in format for phenix.refine

::

    simple_ncs_from_pdb.ncs

-  NCS operators written in format for the PHENIX Wizards

::

    simple_ncs_from_pdb.ncs_spec

Examples
--------

Standard run of simple\_ncs\_from\_pdb:
---------------------------------------

Running simple\_ncs\_from pdb is easy. For example, you can type:

::

    phenix.simple_ncs_from_pdb anb.pdb

Simple\_ncs\_from\_pdb will analyze the chains in anb.pdb and identify
any NCS that exists. For this sample run the following output is
produced:

::

    Chains in this PDB file:  ['A', 'N', 'B']
    GROUPS BASED ON QUICK COMPARISON: [['A', 'B']]
    Looking for invariant domains for ...: ['A', 'N', 'B'] [[[2, 525]],
    [[2, 259], [290, 525]], [[20, 525]]]

There were 3 chains in the PDB file A, N and B. Chains A and B were very
similar and clearly related by NCS. This relationship was found in a
quick comparison. Chain N had the same sequence as A and B, but was not
in the identical comparison. Searching for domains that did have NCS
among all three chains produced three domains, represented below by 4
NCS groups:

::

    GROUP 1
    Summary of NCS group with 3 operators:
    ID of chain/residue where these apply: [['A', 'N', 'B'], [[[2, 5], [20, 35],
    [60, 76], [78, 107], [110, 137], [401, 431], [433, 483], [485, 516],
    [520, 525]], [[2, 5], [20, 35], [60, 76], [78, 107], [110, 137],
    [401, 431], [433, 483], [485, 516], [520, 525]], [[2, 5], [20, 35],
    [60, 76], [78, 107], [110, 137], [401, 431], [433, 483], [485, 516],
    [520, 525]]]]
    RMSD (A) from chain A:  0.0  1.09  0.07
    Number of residues matching chain A:[215, 215, 194]
    Source of NCS info: anb.pdb

The residues in chains A, B, and N in this group are 2-5, 20-35, 60-76,
78-107, 110-137, 401-431, 433-483, 485-516 and 520-525. Note that these
are not all contiguous. These are all the residues that all have the
same relationships among the 3 chains. The RMSD of CA atoms between
chains A and N is 1.09 A and between A and B is 0.07 A.

The NCS information is written in three formats:

::

    NCS operators written in format for resolve to: simple_ncs_from_pdb.resolve
    NCS operators written in format for phenix.refine to: simple_ncs_from_pdb.ncs
    NCS written as ncs object information to: simple_ncs_from_pdb.ncs_spec

The contents of the simple\_ncs\_from\_pdb.ncs\_spec file, which you can
edit if you want and which you can use in the AutoBuild Wizard, are
shown below. NOTE: The ncs operators describe how to map the N'th
ncs-related copy on to the first copy.

Possible Problems
-----------------

Specific limitations and problems:
----------------------------------

-  If user specifies chains to be in a suggested NCS group, but they are
   too dissimilar as a whole (rmsd > max\_rmsd\_use) then the group is
   rejected even if some fragment of the chains could be similar.

-  Chain specification from suggested\_ncs\_groups could in principle
   have than one chain in one group...and simple\_ncs\_from\_pdb can
   only use suggested groups that consist of N copies of single chains.

-  If the NCS asymmetric unit of your crystal contains more than one
   chain, simple\_ncs\_from\_pdb will consider it to have more than one
   domain, and it will assign one NCS group to each chain.
