Build water into cryo-EM map using phenix.douse
===============================================

`phenix.douse` is a tool to build water into cryo-EM maps.

Availability
------------

Command line, GUI.

Required inputs
---------------

Atomic model (PDB or mmCIF format) and map (MRC format).

`resolution` is required if `cc_mask_filter` is set to True.

Optional inputs
---------------

`mode = whole` or `per_chain`: work on the whole model or per chain. Working on 
the whole model may require a lot of memory.

`sphericity_filter = True`: use peak sphericity criteria. Disable to add more water.

`scc = 0.5`: map peak sphericity characteristic. Decrease to add more water.

`keep_input_water = False`: keep or remove existing water.

`dist_min = 2.0`: minimal peak-peak or peak-atom distance. Decrease to add more water.

`dist_max = 3.2`: maximal peak-peak or peak-atom distance. Increase to add more water.

`step = 0.3`: map re-sampling step.

`map_threshold_scale = 0.5`: map threshold for peak selection = (mean map value 
at atom centers) * map_threshold_scale
Decrease to add more water.

`cc_mask_filter = True`: Reject water with CC_mask < cc_mask_filter_threshold.

`cc_mask_filter_threshold = 0.5`: CC_mask threshold for rejecting water.

Limitations
-----------

P1 symmetry is the only supported symmetry.

Assumptions
-----------

Macromolecular part of the atomic model is as compltete as possible (no missing
chains or other unmodelled parts present).

Map resolution is sufficently high to expect water oxygens be visible in the map.

Example
-------

   phenix.douse model.pdb map.mrc resolution=2.5
   
`resolution` is required if `cc_mask_filter` is set to True.
