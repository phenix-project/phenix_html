Build water into cryo-EM map using phenix.douse
===============================================

`phenix.douse` is a tool to build water into cryo-EM maps.

Availability
------------

Command line, GUI.

Required inputs
---------------

Atomic model (PDB or mmCIF format) and map (MRC format).

Optional inputs
---------------

`mode = whole` or `per_chain`: work on the whole model or per chain. Working on 
the whole model may require a lot of memory.

`sphericity_filter = True`: use peak sphericity criteria. Disable to add more water.

`keep_input_water = False`: keep or remove existing water.

`dist_min = 2.0`: minimal peak-peak or peak-atom distance. Decrease to add more water.

`dist_max = 3.2`: maximal peak-peak or peak-atom distance. Increase to add more water.

`step = 0.3`: map re-sampling step.

`map_threshold = 1.0`: scale factor for automatically determined map threshold.
Decrease to add more water.

`scc05 = 0.97` and `scc1 = 0.9`: sphericity characteristics. Decrease to add more water.

Limitations
-----------

P1 symmetry is the only supported symmetry.

Assumptions
-----------

Macromolecular part of the atomic model is as compltete as possible (no missing
chains or other unmodelled parts present).

Map resolution is sufficently high to expect water oxygens be visible in the map.

Example
-------

   phenix.douse model.pdb map.mrc
