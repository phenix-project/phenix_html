Theory and Background
=====================

AFITT refinement in Phenix combines the power and functionality of
Phenix crystallographic refinement with OpenEye
AFITT's [Wlodek2006]_ implementation of the
MMFF94s [Halgren1996]_ force field for accurate modeling of small
molecule stereochemistry.  In combination they provide the user with a
cutting-edge crystallographic refinement package while ensuring
chemically sensible ligand geometry that significantly reduces
conformational strain as compared to traditional
refinement. Phenix.refine is a component of the highly regarded Phenix
suite of crystallography software. AFITT is OpenEye's comprehensive
package for ligands in crystallography. It provides an automated real
space ligand fitting process, refinement dictionary generator,
implementation of MMFF94, MMFF94s, PM3 and AM1 force fields and the
OpenEye's core SZYBKI optimizer.

Phenix.refine employs a maximum likelihood approach to minimize the
following residual or energy function:

  E_{Phenix}=E_{x-ray}+E_{geometry}

where, in the presence of ligands, the second term in the above
equation can be further broken down into:


  E_{geometry}=E_{protein}+E_{ligand\_non-bonded}+E_{ligand\_bonded}

Phenix-AFITT replace Phenix's bonded ligand term with an AFITT term,
thus yielding the following final energy function:

  E_{Phenix-AFITT}=E_{x-ray}+E_{geometry}-E_{ligand\_bonded}^{Phenix}+E_{ligand\_bonded}^{AFITT}


Phenix's implementation of AFITT is versatile, easy to use and powerful. 
It can support
any ligand for which a cif dictionary has been created. Refinements
can include different types of ligands and multiple instances of each
ligand type. Support for ligands with full or partial alternate
conformations is fully integrated as is refinement of ligands
covalently bound to the macromolecule.

Running refinement with Phenix and AFITT
========================================

First, the user should make sure that the latest version of Phenix and
AFITT are installed. On Linux, make sure that the OE_DIR
environment variable is set and points to a valid directory. For
example:

::

	[~:]$ echo $OE_DIR
	/home/pawelrc/.OpenEye

Second prepare the .pdb, .mtz and .cif dictionaries for non-standard
residues in your model. One simple way to create the cif file is to
use AFITT's *writedict* facility:

::

  writedict -in mymodel.pdb -out myligand -planarAniline -nolookup  
          -dictionary_type phenix

Make sure you specify the -type 2 flag. The former ensures that
MMFF94s is used (parameters for crystallographic structures which
experience the effect of time and space averaging ). The latter
creates cif dictionaries specifically compatible with
Phenix.refine. Now running Phenix-AFITT refinement is just a question
of running standard Phenix.refine with some additional keywords. For
example like this:

::

  phenix.refine mymodel.pdb mymodel.mtz myligand.cif use_afitt=True 
         afitt.ligand_file=myligand.cif afitt.ligand_names=UNL,BCL


The above command will run Phenix.refine with AFITT energy and
gradients applied to the ligands UNL and BCL according to the topology
provided in the file myligand.cif. The following is the full list of
AFITT-related keyword that the user can specify on the command line
when running Phenix.refine:

  REQUIRED KEYWORDS
    use_afitt - turn on ligand refinement with AFITT. (default = False)

    afitt.ligand_file_name - relative path to cif dictionary file that
      defines the ligand topology for AFITT. Note that this can be
      different from the cif file provided to Phenix.refine on the
      command line without any keyword. The former specifies the
      topology of the ligand for AFITT. The actual bond and angle
      parameters in it are irrelevant. The latter specifies the both
      topology and parameters of non-standard residues for Phenix. Any
      ligands that are not refined by AFITT (using the "ligand\_names"
      keyword) will be refined by Phenix.refined using the parameters in
      this file.

    afitt.ligand_names - three letter ligand name codes. If multiple
      ligand types are being refined, separate each three letter code by
      a comma, no spaces. For a given ligand name, AFITT will refine all
      instances of that ligand as well as alternate conformations of
      each ligand.

  OPTIONAL KEYWORDS

    afitt.ff - AFITT force field to use. Options are: mmff94s, mmff94, am1, pm3. (default=mmff94s)

    afitt.scale - weight to place on the AFITT ligand energy term. (default=10)

Auxiliary functions
===================

Two auxiliary command line programs are provided for
convenience. *mmtbx.afitt* returns the AFITT ligand
conformational energy given a pdb file (for coordinates) and cif file
(for topology) and the three letter names of the ligands the user is
querying. Optionally the user can specify the AFITT force field to use
using the "-ff" keyword (default=MMFF94s). Example usage:

::

  [~/work/afitt:]$ mmtbx.afitt 1cvu.pdb 1cvu.cif BOG,ACD
    BOG_702_ AFITT_ENERGY:  2152.1468
    BOG_703_ AFITT_ENERGY:  2151.5215
    BOG_704_ AFITT_ENERGY:  2137.6938
    BOG_2702_ AFITT_ENERGY:  2145.0459
    BOG_2704_ AFITT_ENERGY:  2099.0437
    ACD_701_ AFITT_ENERGY:   136.1296
    ACD_2701_ AFITT_ENERGY:    99.7701

*mmtbx.afitt_fd* runs a finite difference test to check that the
Phenix-AFITT energy and gradients are being properly calculated. This
is the first test to run if you think something may be wrong with the
implementation of the refinement algorithm. *mmtbx.afitt_fd*
requires a pdb file, cif file, ligand names and atom number on whose
x-coordinate the finite difference test will be calculated. An
optional "-v" keyword provides more verbose output about the
individual terms of the energy function. Example usage:

::

  [~/work/afitt:]$ mmtbx.afitt_fd 1cvu.pdb 1cvu.cif ACD 9321
  -> 0.134306495
  -> 0.134306174
  TEST PASSES: (analytical - numerical)= -0.000000321


As always, running an auxiliary program with the "-h" keyword provides
helpful information about the program.
