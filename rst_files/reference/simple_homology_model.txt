Homology modelling using simple_homology_model
==============================================

.. contents::

Purpose
-------

This program can be used for building a homology model for a target sequence
using a template structure and an alignment.

Installation
------------

``simple_homology_model`` uses Rosetta, software developed in the Baker
laboratory at the University of Washington. See the central
`installation notes for Rosetta`__.

__ rosetta_install.html

Usage
-----

``simple_homology_model`` is available from the command line.

Input files
-----------

-  **Structure** *(compulsory)*. The template structure.
   Accepted formats: PDB. Recognized extensions: ``.pdb``, ``.ent``.
-  **Alignment** *(compulsory)*. Alignment between the target and template
   sequences.
   Accepted formats:

   + ``.aln``: CLUSTAL format.
   + ``.pir``: PIR format.
   + ``.ali``: relaxed PIR-like format.

- **Sequence** *(optional)*. The complete target sequence if the alignment does
  not fully cover it. If not specified, the first sequence from the alignment
  will be used as target.

Output files
------------

The homology model is written out as specified in ``output.model``.

Description
-----------

The program first discard all residues from the template structure that are not
present in the target and morphs the residue type when they are (this step is
performed by Sculptor_ and is governed by the alignment). The missing segments
are detected, a suitable loop modelling setup is devised, which is then fed
into Rosetta_ to do the actual building. For a summary of all keywords with the
corresponding defaults, see the `Additional information`_ section.

Chain-to-alignment-matching
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This controls how chain-to-alignment matching is performed. For more
information, see the `Sculptor documentation`__.

Homology modelling setup
++++++++++++++++++++++++

For each loop, the program backtracks ``min_residue_margin`` number of residues
on both ends, then checks the distance between bridge residues. If this is
shorter than ``residue_distance`` * number-of-residues-in-between, than
backtracks one residues more on each side, and keeps doing this until the
criterion is statisfied, or hits a terminus on either end. After this, it
evaluates residue segments that are not assigned for loop modelling and will be
kept fixed during the modelling step. Segments shorter than
``min_edge_segment_length`` will be discarded at the termini, and shorter than
``min_intenal_segment_length`` will be discarded internally, and the
surrounding loops joined. It then checks the loop lengths, and stops with an
error message if a loop is longer than ``max_loop_length``.

Homology modelling
++++++++++++++++++

The program runs Rosetta_ with a kinematic loop closure algorithm
(``rosetta_loop_closure``), as this does not require selected fragments. After
the loop is closed, Rosetta can be instructed to run a refinement
(``rosetta_loop_refinement``).

Command line
------------

::

    phaser.simple_homology_model \
        [ command-line switches ] \
        [ PHIL-format parameter files ] \
        [ PHIL command-line assignments ] \
        [ PDB file ] \
        [ alignment file ] \
        [ sequence file ]

Command-line switches:
++++++++++++++++++++++

::


      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      --show-defaults       print PHIL and exit
      -i, --stdin           read PHIL from stdin as well

PHIL arguments:
+++++++++++++++

Everything not starting with a dash('-') is interpreted as a PHIL
argument. This can be a PHIL-format file containing parameters,
command-line assignment or a file whose type is automatically recognized
(based on file extension; structure files and alignment files are
recognized automatically).

Warning and error messages
--------------------------

Error messages
++++++++++++++

- ``Structure file is missing``: no PDB file specified.
- ``Chain .. is not recognised as protein``: the chain specified for modelling
  is not protein.
- ``Alignment file is missing``: no alignment file specified.
- ``Could not match chain with alignment``: chain-to-alignment matching was not
  successful (reason indicated in previous line).
- ``..: loop longer than maximum allowed``: loop .. is longer than the maximum
  allowed.
- ``Incomplete Rosetta environment setup: ..``: Rosetta environment is not
  setup.
- ``Cannot locate loopmodel: ..": the ``loopmodel`` Rosetta executable is not
  found.
- ``Cannot locate Rosetta database``: the Rosetta database is not found.
- ``Rosetta finished with error code ..``: Rosetta exited with an error code.
- ``No models produced``: although Rosetta exited indicating success, no model
  is created.

Warnings
++++++++

- ``No sequence file provided``: no sequence file provided, the first sequence
  from the alignment will be used as target.
- `` Multiple models output - using only first``: Rosetta generated multiple
  models, and only the first on will be used.
