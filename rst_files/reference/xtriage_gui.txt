Configuration
-------------

The minimum input for xtriage is a reflection file and symmetry
information, which for MTZ files is automatically extracted.  A sequence file
is helpful for calculting expected solvent content.  A model file (PDB or
mmCIF), if available, will be used in the calculation of twinning statistics.

To launch Xtriage, open the main Phenix GUI and click on or drag-and-drop a
reflection file onto the Xtriage module.  The command-line equivalent is
``phenix.xtriage_gui``; most parameters recognized by the command-line program
should work here as well.  The configuration window is minimal:

.. image:: ../images/xtriage_main.png

The **Parameters** button opens a window containing the most essential
information about the reflection data, including choice of data to analyze
if more than one suitable Miller array is present.  Xtriage will accept
any reflection file format and both intensities and amplitudes, but
a Scalepack or MTZ file with separate I+/I- is the most typical input.  (We
recommend using unmerged data as it will be used in additional analyses of
data quality and anomalous signal, but this is optional.)  Most
of this information will be extracted automatically if possible; at a minimum,
only the input data and crystal symmetry are required.  A complete listing
of parameters can be found in the `manual for the command-line version
<xtriage.html>`_.  Xtriage is also
run automatically by the wizards (AutoSol, AutoBuild) and the
graphical results can be viewed from the GUIs for those programs as well.


---------------------------
Interpreting Xtriage output
---------------------------

The output of the GUI is nearly identical in content to the output of the
command-line version.  The analyses performed are divided into several
categories, covered in more detail below:

  - **Merging statistics**: these evaluate the agreement and quality of
    redundant experimental observations.  Only included if unmerged data were
    used as input.
  - **Solvent content and Matthews coefficient**: attempts to guess the
    crystal contents based on unit cell and space group (and optionally,
    information about the crystallized molecules).
  - **Data strength and completeness**: analysis of signal-to-noise ratio both
    as an overall average and as a fraction of all possible reflections, and
    checking for pathologically incomplete data.
  - **Absolute scaling and Wilson analysis**: calculates overall isotropic and
    anisotropic B-factors for the data, and compares the Wilson plot to an
    empirical function derived from PDB structures.  This also includes the
    detection of ice rings and other pathologies.
  - **Anomalous signal**: indicates approximate quality of anomalous signal,
    if anomalous data were provided.
  - **Systematic absences**: examines the intensity of systematically absent
    reflections given different space group choices.  (Note that if you have
    already scaled in a specific space group (e.g. P212121), these reflections
    may have already been removed from the input file.)
  - **Diagnostic tests for twinning and pseudosymmetry**: analysis of intensity
    distribution statistics to detect abnormal data, usually the result of
    twinning or translational NCS.
  - **Twin law tests**: determine which twin laws are permitted in the given
    crystal symmetry, and estimate the twin fraction in each case.  (Note that
    these are purely theoretical guesses, and do not by themselves indicate
    that the data are actually twinned.)
  - **Exploring higher metric symmetry**: if the crystal symmetry permits
    merging into higher-symmetry space groups, calculate the merging R-factors
    in each case.

Several additional sections summarize the results from various analyses.  You
can navigate between sections via the drop-down menu near the top of the
results tab.

Alerts for problematic results
==============================

The first tab provides warnings for a variety of common problems:

.. image:: ../images/xtriage_summary.png

Each box can be clicked to jump to the detailed results in another tab.
Analyses tagged with a red icon indicate issues that are likely to make various
downstream steps such as phasing and refinement difficult (to varying degrees).
Some of these may be remedied by better data processing, but they may be due to
inherent issues of crystal quality.  Yellow icons indicate issues that may
produce sub-optimal results but are not necessarily fatal - for instance, if
the resolution limit appears to have been chosen too conservatively.  Green
icons indicate that the data are of acceptable quality.

Merging statistics
==================

If you provide unmerged (but scaled) intensities as input, the program
`phenix.merging_statistics <unmerged_data.html>`_ will be run internally and
the results displayed in their own tab.

.. image:: ../images/xtriage_merging_overall.png

In addition to the overall analysis, tables and plots display statistics by
resolution shell, first for general counting statistics and signal-to-noise,
second for various measures of data quality (including R-merge and CC1/2).

.. image:: ../images/xtriage_dataset_consistency.png

Clicking the plot button below a table opens plots for each set of analyses in
a separate window.

.. image:: ../images/xtriage_cc_one_half.png

Data quality analyses
=====================

*Data strength.*  Xtriage displays two graphs of signal-to-noise ratio, one
overall plot by resolution range, and a second combining signal-to-noise and
completeness (shown below).  These are very similar to the output of
data-processing programs such as HKL2000 and the CCP4 suite (MOSFLM/SCALA),
and usually do not vary greatly unless the data are systematically incomplete
and/or very weak.

.. image:: ../images/xtriage_s2n.png

This analysis is also used in the automatic determination of the high
resolution limit used in the intensity statistics and twin analyses.  A
separate table shows completeness for low-resolution data alone.

Low resolution completeness analysis.
-------------------------------------

Most data processing software do not provide a clear picture of the
completeness of the data at low resolution. For this reason, xtriage lists
the completeness of the data up to 5 Angstrom:

.. image:: ../images/xtriage_low_res.png

This analysis allows one to quickly see if there is any unusually low completeness at low resolution, for instance due to missing overloads.

Wilson scaling.
------------------------------------------

A Wilson plot analysis a la ARP/wARP is carried out, albeit with a slightly
different standard curve.  This determines overall B-factors (isotropic and
anisotropic) for the data.  A large spread in the diagonal values indicates
anisotropy, as shown below (however, this example, the p9-sad structure
included in the ``examples`` directory of the Phenix distribution, is actually
very good data).  The shape of the curve does not vary greatly for
most data, and a large deviation from expected values is unusual.  However,
the resolution at which the maximum of the curve is found will be different
depending on the type of molecule crystallized (protein vs. nucleic acid).

.. image:: ../images/xtriage_wilson_good.png

Problems with the Wilson plot will be identified and reported; again, the
p9-sad example is relatively free of pathologies:

.. image:: ../images/xtriage_wilson_outliers.png

A very long list of warnings could indicate a serious problem with your
data. Decisions on whether or not the data is useful, should be cut or
should thrown away altogether, is not straightforward and falls beyond the
scope of Xtriage.

Ice ring detection.
-------------------

Ice rings in the data are detected by analyzing the completeness and the mean intensity:

.. image:: ../images/xtriage_ice_good.png

Anomalous signal.
-----------------

If the input reflection file contains separate intensities for each Friedel
mate, an approximate measure of the anomalous signal is reported.  The p9-sad
example, a high-resolution SeMet SAD dataset, is shown again:

.. image:: ../images/xtriage_anom_good.png

Suggested resolution cutoffs at which the anomalous signal disappears are
shown by the vertical lines.  Note that these are intended for heavy-atom
substructure determination using for example `HySS <hyss.html>`_; they are not
especially robust as a measure of quality.  The p9-sad example is unusually excellent; a
more difficult (but still solvable) dataset, the sec17 example in the Phenix
distribution, is below:

.. image:: ../images/xtriage_anom_poor.png

Measurability values above 0.05 are encouraging; if the data do not reach this
threshold at a usable resolution, successful phasing by SAD/MAD is extremely
unlikely.

A more useful indicator of anomalous signal quality is the CC(anom), which is
calculated if unmerged data are provided.  This is essentially similar to
CC1/2: the unmerged observations are separated into two pools, each of which is
then merged (keeping Friedel mates separate), and the correlation coefficient
of their anomalous differences is calculated.  Values above 0.3 are very
encouraging.

.. image:: ../images/xtriage_cc_anom.png

Twinning analyses
=================

Xtriage will print a summary of its interpretation of twinning analyses at
the top of the tab, including merohedral and pseudo-merohedral twin laws
compatible with the lattice.  Below is the output for the pseudo-merohedrally
twinned ``porin-twin`` example data:

.. image:: ../images/xtriage_twinning_summary.png

Intensity distribution statistics
---------------------------------

Two separate tests for twinning rely on the cumulative distribution of
intensities.  Both of these result in plots with a distinctive shapes for
normal vs. twinned data.  The first, the NZ test, is shown below for the
untwinned ``p9-sad`` data:

.. image:: ../images/xtriage_no_twin.png

The plot for a twinned dataset has sigmoidal curve instead:

.. image:: ../images/xtriage_nz_pm.png

Translational NCS (and translational pseudosymmetry) will also result in
an abnormal curve, shifted up relative to the expected distribution.  Below
is the NZ test plot for an untwinned dataset with translational pseudosymmetry:

.. image:: ../images/xtriage_nz_pt.png

Because the combination of twinning and translational NCS may result in a
curve that appears close to normal, it is important to consider the second
test for twinning, the L-test.  Here, twinning is indicated by an upwards
shift of the curve relative to expected values:

.. image:: ../images/xtriage_l_pm.png

Twin law tests
--------------

If the crystal symmetry is compatible with one or more twin laws, each of
these will be analyzed separately to determine the expected twin fraction.
Most of these will result in a very low twin fraction whether or not twinning
is present, but the actual twin law, if any, will usually have a significantly
higher value, reflected in the shape of the curves.  Results from an untwinned
crystal typically look like this:

.. image:: ../images/xtriage_twin_laws.png

The actual twin law for the ``porin-twin`` example:
