MolProbity is a web application that integrates validation programs from
the Richardson lab at Duke University.

Purpose
-------

MolProbity provides the user with an expert-system consultation about
the accuracy of a macromolecular structure model, diagnosing local
problems and enabling their correction. It combines all atom contact
analysis with updated versions of more traditional tools for validating
geometry and dihedral-angle combinations. MolProbity is most complete
for crystal structures of proteins and RNA, but also handles DNA,
ligands, and NMR ensembles. It works best as an **active** validation
tool - used as soon as a model is available and during each
rebuild/refine loop, not just at the end to provide global statistics
before deposition. It produces coordinates, graphics, and numerical
evaluations that integrate with either manual or automated use in
systems such as PHENIX, KiNG, or Coot.

Usage
-----

The integrated MolProbity web application is at
`http://molprobity.biochem.duke.edu/ <http://molprobity.biochem.duke.edu/>`__.
The user is guided through a work-flow that typically consists of:

- Fetch or upload model(s)
- Add & optimize H atoms, with correction of Asn/Gln/His flips
- Calculate per-residue & global quality analyses:
   - all-atom steric clashes
   - geometry (e.g., Cbeta or ribose pucker ideality)
   - Ramachandran, sidechain rotamer, or RNA backbone outliers
   - global MolProbity score

- View multi-criterion chart and/or on-line 3D KiNG graphics summaries
- [Optional features, e.g. interface analysis; load maps for on-line
  viewing; Coot to-do list]
- Download coordinate & graphics files for further work on local
  corrections

An increasingly broad subset of MolProbity functionalities are
integrated directly into PHENIX for use in refinement, Resolve, and
wizard decisions. These are all available in the PHENIX GUI as part of
the \`comprehensive validation interface \`\_, which runs all available
analyses and provides convenient links to molecular graphics software.
Phenix.reduce provides optimized hydrogen addition, phenix.probe and
quick\_clashlist.py provide all-atom clash analysis, and python versions
of the Ramachandran and rotamer scores are available in the mmtbx.
Interactive all-atom contact dots are also available in Coot.

Possible Problems
-----------------

Web usage requires Java, Javascript, and a modern web browser.

MolProbity provides reasonable session protection, but if security or
large-scale usage are at issue, you can install MP to run on your own
Linux or Mac computer provided that the computer has a web server
(Apache), the PHP scripting language, JAVA, and a few common Unix
utility programs. For more information, follow the "Download MolProbity"
link on the MP main page.
