The Phenix atom selection syntax
================================

.. contents::

Introduction
------------

Many of the programs in Phenix, and `phenix.refine <refine_gui.html>`__ in
particular, allow (or require) you to specify selections
of atoms in a model.  Common examples include:

  - TLS (constrained anisotropic displacement) and rigid-body refinement groups
  - Selections for isotropic versus anisotropic B-factor refinement
  - Atoms to leave out for omit map calculation
  - Subset of atoms to modify properties for (in `PDBTools <pdbtools.html>`__)
  - Harmonically restrain atoms during refinement

All of these parameters are defined using a common syntax similar to what is
used in `CNS <http://cns-online.org>`__ or `PyMOL <http://pymol.org>`__.
The syntax allows for selection of atomic properties such as atom name,
residue number, chain ID, or B-factor, which can be combined by the use of
simple boolean statements (``and``, ``or``, or ``not``).

The `tutorial video <https://youtu.be/K28q378F39s>`_ is available on the
`Phenix YouTube channel
<https://www.youtube.com/c/phenixtutorials>`_ and covers the
following topics:

- Basic overview
- Examples for selection syntax
- Examples for combined expressions
- How to test if an expression works (phenix.pdb_atom_selection)

Examples for selection expressions
----------------------------------

**All atoms**
::

    all

**All C-alpha atoms (not case sensitive)**
::

    name ca

**All atoms with H in the name (* is a wildcard character)**
::

    name *H*

**Atoms names with * (backslash disables wildcard function)**
::

    name o2\*

**All atoms in 'A' conformation**
::

    altloc A

**Atom names with spaces**
::

    name 'O 1'

**Atom names with primes don't necessarily have to be quoted**
::

    name o2'

**Boolean "and", "or", and "not"**
::

    resname ALA and (name ca or name c or name n or name o)
    chain a and not altid b
    resid 120 and icode c and model 2
    segid a and element c and charge 2+ and anisou

Note that the ``and``, ``or``, and ``not`` operators have equal priority, so
parentheses may be required to indicate which clauses go together.
The first example above selects for all atoms with the specified names in
alanine residues, but if the parentheses are omitted::

    resname ALA and name ca or name c or name n or name o

it will instead select C-alpha atoms in ALA, plus all atoms named C, N, or O
regardless of residue name.

Also note that the outcome of boolean expression can be somewhat different from
what one may expect comparing it with natural language. For example, if one
wants to select ALA and GLY residues in the molecule, the selection should be
::

    resname ALA or resname GLY

because suitable residues have residue name ALA or GLY. On the contrary,
selection
::

    resname ALA and resname GLY

will result in empty selection because there is no residue that can satisfy
both conditions simultaneously.

**A single residue by number**
::

    resseq 188

Note that if there are several chains containing residue number 188, all of
them will be selected. To be more specific and select residue 188 in particular
chain::

    chain A and resid 188

this will select residue 188 only in chain A.

**A range of residues**
::

    resseq 2:10

This selects all residue numbers falling within this range, independent of
their order in the PDB file.  The numbering must be ascending; ``resseq 10:2``
will not work.

**Insertion codes**

``resid`` combines the residue number (``resseq``) with the insertion code (icode); thus the following selections are identical::

    resid 188
    resseq 188 and icode ' '

as are these::

    resid 27C
    resseq 27 and icode 'C'

**Specifying ordered ranges of residues**

For some purposes, such as specifying TLS groups, it may be impractical to
specify a numerical range of ``resseq`` attributes.  This is especially the
case when the residue numbering is not continuous and ascending, which is
found in some PDB entries, or when the insertion code is non-blank.  An
alternative is to define a series of residues by their combined number and
insertion code, using the ``through`` keyword::

    chain A and resid 1000 through 17J

In this case, the residues will be examined in the order that they appear in
the PDB file, and every atom falling between 1000 and 17J in chain A will
be included.  This is the only situation where the ordering of atoms is
important in atom selections.

**B-factors and occupancies**

You may also select atoms based on their numerical properties::

    bfactor > 80
    bfactor = 0
    occupancy < 1
    occupancy = 0

**Other**

A few additional keywords are supported::

    element H
    water
    pepnames
    hetero

These examples specify hydrogen atoms, water molecules (detected by residue
name), common amino acid residues, and atoms labeled as HETATM, respectively.

**Selecting no atoms**
::

    (not all)

The default value of most selections is ``None`` (which in the GUI will appear
as a blank field), but the treatment of this differs depending on how the
atom selection will be used.  For omit selections, ``None`` is equivalent to
``(not all)``; for rigid-body selections, phenix.refine will default to
treating the entire model as a single rigid body.  For B-factor refinement,
leaving the selections set to ``None`` will result in their parameterization
being determined based on the input model and atom type (hydrogens are
treated specially).

Graphical selection
-------------------

In the phenix.refine GUI, any valid
atom selection can be visualized if you have a suitable graphics card
and have already loaded a PDB file with valid symmetry information.  The
graphics window can be opened by clicking the "View/pick" button next
to any atom selection field.  Depending on the size of your structure, it
may take several seconds for PHENIX to determine the atomic connectivity.
The current selection, if any, will be highlighted:

.. image:: ../images/gui_atom_selection.png

The *View/pick* button opens a window that allows you to type in
selections and immediately visualize the results, including the number of
atoms selected.  On mice with at least two buttons, clicking on an atom
with the right button will open a menu for selecting residue ranges or
chains.  However, we
recommend that you learn the selection syntax, as it is much more flexible
than mouse controls.  Selections made in the graphics window will be sent
automatically to the appropriate control.

Once this window is open, it does not need to be closed; clicking a different
"View/pick" button will transfer control of the display.  (On Linux, you
will first need to open the *Actions* menu and click *Restore parent window*
to transfer mouse and keyboard controls back to the configuration dialog.)

"Smart" selections
------------------

In some contexts (primarily in `phenix.refine <refine_gui.html>`__ and
`PDBTools <pdbtools.html>`__), the geometry restraints information is used
to extend the allowed keywords::

    resname ALA and backbone
    resname ALA and sidechain
    peptide backbone
    rna backbone or dna backbone
    water or nucleotide
    dna and not (phosphate or ribose)
    within(5, (nucleotide or peptide) backbone)

Note however that these options cannot be visually selected in the Phenix
GUI at present, and they may not be recognized by all programs.
