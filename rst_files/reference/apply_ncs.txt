Purpose
-------

If you have a single copy of your molecule placed in the crystal and you
have a set of NCS operators defined in an ncs\_info.ncs\_spec file (such
as that written by phenix.find\_ncs), you can apply the operators to
your molecule to generate all the NCS copies. This can be useful if you
want to work on one molecule in your asymmetric unit and propagate it to
the other copies. You can generate your ncs\_info.ncs\_spec file using
phenix.find\_ncs and your original model containing all the NCS copies,
then apply it to any one of the individual molecules to regenerate the
others.

Usage
-----

How apply\_ncs works:
---------------------

apply\_ncs assumes that you are supplying it with one copy of your
molecule, placed in your unit cell, and that you are also supplying a
ncs\_info.ncs\_spec file that contains all the NCS operators for your
structure along with the approximate molecular centers where each
operator applies. apply\_ncs assumes that the NCS operator with a center
closest to the center of the molecule you supply (including space-group
symmetry) is the operator corresponding to your input molecule.

apply\_ncs then calculates the transformation for your molecule to
molecule 1, and then uses all the NCS operators to transform molecule 1
to each NCS copy.

*Output files from apply\_ncs*
------------------------------

**apply\_ncs.pdb**: A PDB file with your input molecule placed at all
the NCS-related positions in your structure

Examples
--------

Standard run of apply\_ncs:
---------------------------

Running apply\_ncs is easy. From the command-line you can type:

::

    phenix.apply_ncs  mol1.pdb my_ncs.ncs_spec

If apply\_ncs chooses the wrong NCS copy to match up to your input
molecule, you can tell it which one your input molecule is with
match\_copy:

::

    phenix.apply_ncs mol1.pdb my_ncs.ncs_spec match_copy=2

apply\_ncs will then assume that you are inputting ncs copy 2.
