phenix.map_box: extract box with model and map around selected atoms
====================================================================

**Description**

The program carves out a box with model and map around selected atoms. Resulting
map is output in three files: map coefficients in MTZ, and maps in CCP4 and
X-plor formatted files.

**Usage examples**

  1) Using a map defined in MTZ file as Fourier map coefficients. Box is defined by
     selected atoms in residues from 1 to 10 in chain A

     phenix.map_box model.pdb map_coefficients.mtz selection="chain A and resseq 1:10"


  2) Using a CCP4/mrc formatted map.

     phenix.map_box model.pdb map.ccp4 selection="resname LIG"

     Note that by default map_box chooses a rectangular box that is a little 
     bigger than your model.  If you want the map to be zeroed out away from
     your model you can use the keyword mask_atoms=True.

  3) Extract unique part of a map. You can extract just the unique part of
     a map (unique based on map symmetry).  This map is masked around high
     density. It will normally only have positive density and lower density 
     parts of even the unique part are truncated. Note that if you want to 
     sharpen the map, you must sharpen it before you extract the unique part.
     You should not sharpen a map file created with extract_unique because 
     the extract_unique function creates a map that has been set to zero 
     over much of the map and this interferes with auto-sharpen.

     phenix.map_box map.ccp4 extract_unique=True symmetry.ncs_spec resolution=3

  4) Shift origin of a map.  You can shift the origin of a map (redefine where
     in the unit_cell box the map goes).  Normally you need to also specify
     the the map size should remain the same.

     You can specify the origin directly:

     phenix.map_box map.ccp4 keep_map_size=True prefix=map_origin_shifted \
       output_origin_grid_units=3,5,7

     You can also specify the origin to be (0,0,0) with keep_origin=False:

     phenix.map_box map.ccp4 keep_map_size=True prefix=map_origin_shifted \
       keep_origin=False

     You can also specify that the origin should match the origin of some
     other file. If you do this you have to use the keyword ccp4_map_file
     for the map to be shifted and output_origin_match_this_file for the
     one to match:

     phenix.map_box ccp4_map_file=map.ccp4 keep_map_size=True \
       prefix=map_origin_shifted \
       output_origin_match_this_file=map_with_origin_to_match.ccp4

  5) Cut out a part of a map to match some other map.  You can say:

     phenix.map_box ccp4_map_file=map.ccp4 \
       prefix=map_boxed \
       bounds_match_this_file=map_with_bounds_to_match.ccp4

  6) Invert the hand of a map:

     phenix.map_box ccp4_map_file=map.ccp4 \
       keep_map_size=True \
       invert_hand = True


**Notes**

  1)  By default the output map will superimpose on the input map 
      (keep_origin=True).  The output map is normally smaller than the
      input map. For example, the input map might go 
      from (0,0,0) to (100,100,100) and the output map might include only
      grid points from (50,50,50) to (100,100,100).  The origin of the
      output map in this case will be (50,50,50). If the two maps are
      displayed, the region from (50,50,50) to (100,100,100) will be the same
      for the two maps.  Not that anything outside of this range is
      meaningless for the output map. 

  2)  The cell dimensions of the output map will be the dimensions of the
      part that is cut out.  In the above example, if the starting unit
      cell was (200,200,200) then be output map will have a unit cell of
      (100,100,100).

  3)  Some maps may have a special tag called external_origin. In the map
      file it is called ORIGIN.  This is different than the origin of 
      the map, which specifies the grid point that corresponds to the
      first element in the map.  The external_origin
      tells display programs how to shift a model in order to match the map.
      Phenix ignores the external_origin tag.  If you want to see what its
      value is, you can use phenix.show_map_info to display characteristics
      of our map.  If you want to remove the external_origin tag from your
      map, you can run map_box with "keep_map_size=True" and it will write
      out the same map but without the external_origin tag.  If you want
      to shift a model to match your map, and the map has an external_origin
      tag, you can use the tool phenix.shift_model_to_match_map (command-line
      only).

  4)  How map gridding is described in mrc/ccp4 format. 

      Map specifications. A full map is defined for a full box or 
      unit cell, however in many cases only a part of that map is present.  
      The full map is on a grid of 'unit cell grid' which corresponds to 
      one unit cell (box) with dimensions of 'unit cell parameters'.
      
      The map that is present is on part of the 'unit cell grid'.  It starts
      at the grid point called the 'origin' and goes to one grid point in each
      direction before the grid point called 'last'.  The map that is present
      has 'all' grid points in each direction.  The map that is present has a
      'map unit cell' and 'map grid' that correspond to the dimensions 'all'.
      
      Example: a full map with a unit cell grid of (10, 10, 10) goes from
      (0, 0, 0) to (9, 9, 9) and has dimensions of (10, 10, 10).
      
      Example: a partial map with a unit cell grid of (10,10,10) and an origin
      of (0, 0, 2) and a map grid or 'all' of (6, 6, 6), would go
      from (0, 0, 2) to (5, 5, 7).

  5)  Ignoring symmetry conflicts. If you cut out a part of a map, then the
      new map will have a box size that is different from the orginal one.
      If that box size does not match the box size for your PDB file or other
      map, then you may get an error message that says the symmetry of the
      maps or map and model is not the same.  You can ignore this with the
      keyword ignore_symmetry_conflicts=True.

  6)  Running map_box with bounds that are outside the map.  You can specify
      any lower and upper bounds for your output map, but if the bounds are
      outside the map you supply the values may not make any sense.  By 
      default the map you supply is wrapped so that the value for a point 
      outside the map is taken from the grid point that would be in this place
      if another copy of the map were placed right next to your map.  You can
      turn this off and instead supply zeroes outside the map with the
      keyword restrict_map_size=True.
