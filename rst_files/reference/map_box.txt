phenix.map_box: extract box with model and map around selected atoms
====================================================================

**Description**

The program carves out a box with model and map around selected atoms. Resulting
map is output in three files: map coefficients in MTZ, and maps in CCP4 and
X-plor formatted files.

**Usage examples**

  1) Using map defined in MTZ file as Fourier map coefficients. Box is defined by
     selected atoms in residues from 1 to 10 in chain A

     phenix.map_box model.pdb map_coefficients.mtz selection="chain A and resseq 1:10"


  2) Using CCP4 formatted map

     phenix.map_box model.pdb map.ccp4 selection="resname LIG"
