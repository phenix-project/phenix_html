Purpose
-------

The routine resolve_cryo_em is a tool for carrying out density modification
of cryo-EM maps

Usage

How resolve_cryo_em works:
--------------------------

Density modification with resolve_cryo_em is based on two ideas.  
One is that the errors in Fourier coefficients representing a cryo-EM map are
(to some extent) uncorrelated. This means that one Fourier coefficient does
not know about the errors in another one. (Note that this is not including
errors that are correlated simply because the molecule is small and is 
placed in a large map. Correlated errors in this context are those where one
Fourier coefficient has been adjusted to compensate for errors in another one.)

The other is that some features in a map are known in advance.  This could 
include features such as the flatness of the solvent region, distributions
of map values in the solvent and macromolecule region, similarities of
symmetry-related regions.

Then the way density modification works is that Fourier coefficients for 
the map are adjusted to agree both with the original map and with
the expected features. This improves the Fourier coefficients,
and the key result is that the map improves everywhere, not just where
the information about expected features was available.

Unique features of density modification for cryo-EM are that two half-maps with
independent errors are available in cryo-EM (allowing estimation of 
errors), and that the errors in Fourier coefficients are (more or less)
distributed as two-dimensional Gaussians (i.e both phase and amplitude
errors).  This leads to many differences in implementation density
modification in crystallography though core elements are identical.

Using resolve_cryo_em: 
----------------------

Normally you will access the functionality of resolve_cryo_em by running
the Phenix map_to_model tool in the Phenix GUI. 
However you can run it directly as well (there is no GUI for resolve_cryo_em).

Half-maps: Supply two unmasked half maps. They can be sharpened but it does
not make much of a difference.

Sequence file:  Supply a sequence file with the sequence of the molecule. Be
sure to put in all copies of the molecule (i.e. a 24-mer needs 24 chains).

Procedure used by resolve_cryo_em
---------------------------------

The inputs to resolve_cryo_em are:

::

  Two unmasked half-maps
  sequence file or molecular mass or solvent fraction

The procedure used by resolve_cryo_em has several steps:

::

  Boxing of maps:  If the supplied maps are much larger than the molecule,
  the maps are trimmed down to about 5 A bigger than the largest dimension
  of the molecule (estimated from a low-res mask and the molecular 
  volume based on sequence or as specified) in each direction.

  Resolution estimate and half-map sharpening of maps: The half-maps are
  compared as a function of resolution and the resolution (FSC=0.143)
  is estimated and the maps are sharpened based on the estimated map quality
  of the full (averaged) map.  A full map is calculated.

  Generation of map-value (density) histograms:  The full map is analyzed
  to identify the distribution of map values in the solvent and 
  macromolecule region.  These histograms are to be used in density 
  modification.

  Density modification of half-maps:  Each half map is density-modified
  using maximum-likelihood density modification. The histograms of map 
  values from the preceding step are used as targets indicating what the
  distribution should be in the density modified maps.

  Estimation of errors:  Fourier coefficients for the two starting 
  half-maps and the two density-modified maps are compared to give FSC
  values as a function of resolution.  These FSC values are used to estimate
  correlated and uncorrelated errors in the four maps and to identify
  optimal weighting between original and density-modified maps.

  Optional real-space and sigma weighting:  The smoothed local rms differences
  between original half maps and between density-modified half maps are 
  used (optionally) to identify location-specific weighting for the
  original and density-modified maps.  The variance of Fourier coefficients
  among the four maps are used (optionally) to weight individual final
  Fourier coefficients.

  Optional spectral scaling and local sharpening.  The final
  map is optionally scaled with a resolution-dependent scale factor 
  representing the radial part of a typical Fourier transform of a 
  macromolecule.  The final map is optionally locally resolution-filtered
  (local sharpening).  The final map is also optionally blurred slightly
  with a blurring dependent on the overall resolution of the map.


Examples
--------

Standard run of resolve_cryo_em:
--------------------------------

You can use resolve_cryo_em to density-modify a cryo-EM map: 

::

   phenix.resolve_cryo_em half_map_A.mrc half_map_B.mrc seq_file=seq.dat

Possible Problems
-----------------

If the half-maps have been masked the procedure may not work well.
If the maps have very prominent density away from the macromolecule this
may interfere with density modification.
If there is non-macromolecule but real density in the maps this 
may interfere with density modification (for example, lipid density).

Specific limitations and problems:
----------------------------------

The density modification procedure works best in the resolution range of about 4.5 A or better.
