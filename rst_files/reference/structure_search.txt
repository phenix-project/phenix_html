Overview
--------

Structure_search is a tool to quickly identify structural homologs of the input PDB file from the Protein Data Bank. It uses the SARST_ algorithm, and it's very fast. A typical search time against the whole PDB is usually less than one second.  There is an option to allow users to obtain a list of ligands found in structures of those homologs.


Usage
-----
  - obtain a list of PDB ids and chains sorted by similarities to mypdb.pdb
     phenix.structure_search mypdb.pdb
  - obtain a list of homologs of mypdb.pdb and all ligands found in structures of those homologs
     phenix.structure_search mypdb.pdb get_ligand=True

More information can be found in input/Output files sections below:

Input files
-----------

required input:

  - **pdb_file**: the file containing the protein model of interest. 

Optional inputs :

  - **get_ligand**:"=True" if want a list of ligands found in homologous PDBs,  Default = False.
  - **job_title**: current job title
  - **output_prefix**: prefix for output files if needed.
  - **get_pdb**:Collect and superpose the top N homologous pdbs (default=10).
  - **coot_display**: Display superposed pdb files in coot. [default=(False/True) as E-value(>/<)1E-18].
  - **sequence_only**: Perform Blast sequence search against PDB database using Phenix internal DB. This
                       option does not require network connection.

Output files
------------

In addition to screen output, these files contains results of structure_search:
  - **output.txt**: file containing homologs of 'pdb_file' sorted by scores.
  - **MyBlast.log**: Standard BLAST output with selected pairwise alignments. NOTE: for structure alignment, the
                     'sequences' are structure-based Ramachandran codes (see reference), not 1-letter code for amino acids.
  - **pdb_ligand.txt** (if get_ligand=True): file containing all ligands found in all homologs from this search.
  - **superposed PDB files**: Can be found in TEMPPDB_## subdirectory as prompted in the program output.
