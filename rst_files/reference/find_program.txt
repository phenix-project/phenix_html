Finding a program or test using find_program
============================================

-  find_program: Tom Terwilliger

Purpose
-------

The routine find_program will show all the programs that match
supplied text (either in program name or in program descriptions).
The locations of the programs (which tab in the GUI or command-line
name) are shown.

Alternatively, find_program can search for a regression test based on
words in the name of the test or based on the name of a module that
is tested by that regression test.

Lastly, find_program can find all the Python programs that have changed
since last checking in programs to github and list all the regression
tests that test those programs.

Usage
-----

How find_program works:
-----------------------

Searches for programs:
----------------------

Find_program uses the list of programs and short descriptions in
the file $PHENIX/modules/phenix/phenix/utilities/phenix_list_help.py
as a list of program names. Additionally it compiles program names
and descriptions from $PHENIX/modules/phenix/wxGUI2/Programs/__init__.params
and $PHENIX/modules/phenix/wxGUI2/Home/Tools.py.

Find_program then makes a list of all programs, descriptions, and locations.
 This list is then searched with the search_text values provided.

Searches for regression tests:
------------------------------

Find_program can also look for and display regression tests.  A
database (test_and_module_info.pkl) of regression tests and all the
modules called by each test is created using the tool 
phenix_regression.get_test_and_module_info.  This database is read
by find_program and can be searched either by words from the name of 
a regression test (providing the full path of the regression test), or
by words from the name of a module (providing the full path of 
regression tests that use that module).

The search for regression tests by module is a way to find a test that
will run a module that you are interested in.

Search for regression tests affecting all changed programs:
-----------------------------------------------------------

Find_program can find all the Python programs that have changed since the last
check-in to github (it uses git to do this). Then for each of these programs,
it finds all the regression tests that are affected.  Then it lists all
the regression tests it finds.

This search is a way to find all the tests that could possibly fail due
to any changed Python module. Note that this search will not find C++
code that is affected. It will also not find code that is accessed in tests
using the easy_run command which uses a system call that does not pass back
traceback information.

Running regression tests
------------------------

The standard framework for running regression tests is described in 
`Running Phenix regression tests <regression_tests.html>`_ .  This
approach uses find_program if you use the git or sort options.

Standard run of find_program:
----------------------------------

You can use find_program to find a program like this:

::

   phenix.find_program search_text=autosol

You can also use it to try and find a regression test that exercises
a routine with the word anomalous in it (anywhere) and also the
word signal (anywhere):

::

  phenix.find_program search_type=tests search_tests_by=function_called search_text=anomalous search_text=signal

Setting up the database for find_program:
-----------------------------------------

You can update the database for find_program by running the tool

::

   phenix_regression.get_test_and_module_info nproc=64

in an empty directory. This will take a while (perhaps an hour or so 
with nproc=64) and produce a file called:

::

  test_and_module_info.pkl

You can copy this file to its official location at:

::

  $PHENIX/modules/phenix_regression/misc/test_and_module_info.pkl

and then find_program will use this new version. You can also
specify where this .pkl file is located with the keyword:

::

  phenix_test_database_file=xxx.pkl



Possible Problems
-----------------

Specific limitations and problems:
----------------------------------

The search_tests and git_affected_tests features of find_program do not find 
C++ code that is affected by a test (only Python code).
