Theory and Background
=====================

In macromolecular crystallographic structure refinement, ligands present
challenges for the generation of geometric restraints due to their large chemical
variability, their possible novel nature and their specific interaction with the
binding pocket of the protein. Quantum-mechanical approaches are useful for
providing accurate ligand geometries, but can be plagued by the number of
minima in flexible molecules. In an effort to avoid these issues, the Quantum
Mechanical Restraints (QMR) procedure optimizes the ligand geometry in situ,
thus accounting for the influence of the macromolecule on the local energy
minima of the ligand. The optimized ligand geometry is used to generate target
values for geometric restraints during the crystallographic refinement. As
demonstrated using a sample of >2330 ligand instances in >1700 protein–ligand
models, QMR restraints generally result in lower deviations from the target
stereochemistry compared with conventionally generated restraints. In particular,
the QMR approach provides accurate torsion restraints for ligands and
other entities.

QMR is part of the Quantum Interface (QI) module that covers the interaction of
Phenix with QM packages.

Running an example
==================

There are two major ways to interact with the QMR modules in Phenix.

1. Run directly in phenix.refine by supplying a PHIL scope to specify
   the ligand details. This will modify the restraints in memory.

2. Run a command line program (mmtbx.quantum_interface) that creates the
   QMR PHIL scope (which also works for the phenix.refine option) and
   then using the same program run the QM step to
   write the restraints file for refinement.

Note: Using the python2 installer requires the setting of the
PHENIX_MOPAC environmental variable to point to the MOPAC executable.
The python3 installer is shipped with the MOPAC executables.

mmtbx.quantum_interface
-----------------------

For a number of reasons, we will cover the latter first. Using the
example of PDB:**4w53**, download from the PDB website using::

  ~> phenix.fetch_pdb 4w53 --mtz

Command to produce PHIL scope for QM minimisation using
mmtbx.quantum_interface is::

  ~> mmtbx.quantum_interface 4w53.pdb format=qi write_qmr_phil=True

which will fail because of the bulk test for hydrogen atoms.

::

   Sorry: Model must have Hydrogen atoms

Also note that the
write_qmr_phil=True option writes a PHIL file. In this example, the format of
the PHIL file works for QI interface but the default works for phenix.refine.Add Hydrogen atoms to the model using::

  ~> phenix.ready_set 4w53.pdb

which produces a file with hydrogens atoms – 4w53.updated.pdb. It also may
produce a restraints file that needs to be used next but in this case
because the restraints for BNZ (benzene) are shipped with Phenix it is not
necessary to supply to the program unless you want a different list of restraints
(not ideal values).
This file can be created cheaply but is needed as the skeleton for the QMR
values to be inserted in the bond, angle and torsion restraints. So, we
can repeat the quantum interface command with the new files.::

  ~> mmtbx.quantum_interface 4w53.updated.pdb format=qi write_qmr_phil=True

This will prompt for the selection of the ligand which in this case is “1”.

::


     1 : "chain A and resid  200  and resname MBN"
     2 : "chain A and resid  201  and resname EPE"

  Enter selection by choosing number or typing a new one ~>

The result is a PHIL scope for MBN QMR restraints::

  4w53.updated_A_200_MBN.phil.

Alternatively, a selection can be supplied directly.::

  mmtbx.quantum_interface 4w53.updated.pdb format=qi write_qmr_phil=True qi.selection="chain A and resid 200 and resname MBN"

A quick tour of the PHIL scope is helpful. The complete scope for the QMR module
is shown at the end of this page. A reduced scope is shown here.

::


  qi.qm_restraints {
    selection = "chain A and resid  200  and resname MBN"
    run_in_macro_cycles = *first_only first_and_last all last_only test
    buffer = 3.5
    calculate = *in_situ_opt starting_energy final_energy starting_strain final_strain starting_bound final_bound starting_higher_single_point final_higher_single_point
    write_files = *restraints pdb_core pdb_buffer pdb_final_core *pdb_final_buffer
    restraints_filename = Auto
    package {
      program = *mopac test
      charge = Auto
      multiplicity = Auto
      method = Auto
      basis_set = Auto
      solvent_model = None
      nproc = 1
      read_output_to_skip_opt_if_available = True
      ignore_input_differences = False
      view_output = None
    }
  }

The key items are the `selection`, `buffer` and `package` items. The `selection`
is the active part of the QM minimisation. The `buffer` is the radius from
the selection to include in the QM environment. The `package` scope
defines the 3rd party QM package details.

The program will also suggest the next command line for running the QM
part of the restraints calculation. The skeleton restraints file may need
to be included.

::

  ~> mmtbx.quantum_interface 4w53.updated.pdb run_qmr=True 4w53.updated_A_200_MBN.phil

The result is a set of QMR restraints::

   4w53.updated_A_200_MBN_3.5_C_PM6-D3H4.cif

Provide this to the desired refinements. The final QM calculation upon
which the restraints are based are in::

   4w53.updated_cluster_final_A_200_MBN_3.5_C_PM6-D3H4.pdb

The input and output files for the MOPAC calculations are in the
directory for inspection.

::

  mopac_4w53.updated_A_200_MBN_3.5_C_PM6-D3H4.out
  mopac_4w53.updated_A_200_MBN_3.5_C_PM6-D3H4.arc
  mopac_4w53.updated_A_200_MBN_3.5_C_PM6-D3H4.mop

phenix.refine
-------------

The restraints file *4w53.updated_A_200_MBN_3.5_C_PM6-D3H4.cif* can be used in
a refinement or the restraints can be calculated on the fly in the refinement run.

To get a PHIL scope for *phenix.refine*, remove the format=qi parameter from the
write_qmr command.::

  ~> mmtbx.quantum_interface 4w53.updated.pdb write_qmr_phil=True qi.selection="chain A and resid 200 and resname MBN"

The refinement command can then be run.::

  ~> phenix.refine 4w53.updated.pdb 4w53.mtz 4w53.updated_A_200_MBN.phil

The major output is below including the name of the restraints file.
