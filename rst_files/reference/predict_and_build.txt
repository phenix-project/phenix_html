Tutorial videos for `X-ray <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LL7pQ60lc8>`_ and `cryo-EM <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrpB_GtpIkU>`_ are available on the `Phenix YouTube channel <https://www.youtube.com/c/phenixtutorials>`_ and cover the following topics:

- basic overview of X-ray or cryo-EM structure determination with AlphaFold models
- how to run PredictAndBuild with X-ray or cryo-EM data via the GUI
- how to interpret the output



Purpose
-------

Predict and build can be used to generate predicted models and to use them
to solve an X-ray structure by molecular replacement or to interpret a cryo-EM map. Predict and build then carries out iterative model rebuilding and
prediction to improve the models. The iterative procedure allows creation of
more accurate predicted models than can be obtained with a simple prediction.

Normally Predict and build is used as a way to automatically generate a 
fairly accurate model starting from just a sequence file and either
cryo-EM half-maps or X-ray data. Additionally Predict and build provides
morphed versions of unrefined predicted models that can be useful as
reference models for refinement.

Steps in predict_and_build
--------------------------

The principal steps in predict_and_build are:

::

  Model prediction (e.g., with AlphaFold)

  Model trimming

  Structure solution by molecular replacement (X-ray)  or map interpretation
  by docking (cryo-EM) to create a scaffold model

  Morphing of original predicted models onto the scaffold model

  Model refinement and rebuilding

  Iteration of model prediction using the rebuilt models as templates

Sequence file
-------------

The sequence file that you supply specifies what is going to be predicted and
how many copies of each chain are present in the structure (one for every copy
in the sequence file).  All models that are created and input will be associated
with one or more of the chains in your sequence file based on sequence 
identity (normally every model should match a chain in the sequence file
exactly).

Input data (cryo-EM)
--------------------

For cryo-EM maps, normally you will supply two full-size half-maps. These will
be used in density modification to create a single full-size map. This map
will then be boxed to extract just the part that contains the molecule (the
part with high density).  Alternatively, you can supply a single full-size or 
boxed map if you wish. 

Input data (X-ray)
------------------

For a crystal structure, you will supply an mtz-style file containing data
for Fobs and sigFobs.  Optionally this file can contain a test set 
(FreeR_flags).  The space group specified in this data file 
and its enantiomer, if any, will be used in structure determination.  This
means you should run `phenix.xtriage <xtriage.html>`_ first so that you have
a good idea of the space group.


Model prediction
----------------

Predict and build normally uses the Phenix server 
to carry out AlphaFold prediction of one chain at a time.  It can
also use predictions that you supply or that you generate on demand and put
in the same place on your computer as those that are created by one of 
the servers.

Prediction (see `phenix.predict_model <predict_model.html>`_ for details)
is fully automated with the Phenix server through the Phenix GUI,
so all you have to do is let it run.  The Phenix GUI will use the Phenix 
server to carry out the prediction and put it in the working directory.

You can specify what inputs the AlphaFold prediction should use.  These
always include a sequence file, but it can include an optional multiple
sequence alignment file, optional templates, keywords for model prediction
such as the number of models to generate, random seed, and whether to use 
multiple sequence alignment.

When prediction is being carried out, the Phenix GUI waits for the predicted
models to appear in the working directory, then it goes on to the next steps.
If you want to create these models in some other way, you can just put them
in the working directory (the expected file names are listed in the GUI when
prediction starts) and they will be used.  Note that all prediction files
must have all the residues in the corresponding sequence present.

Model trimming
--------------

The predicted models are trimmed to remove low-confidence sections and to
split into compact domains using 
`phenix.process_predicted_model <process_predicted_model.html>`_ . This
allows the molecular replacement (X-ray) or docking (cryo-EM) procedures
to use the most accurate parts of the models, increasing the chance of finding
the correct solution.  Splitting into compact domains increases the chance
of correctly placing parts of chains that have different orientations in the
predicted model compared to the actual structure.

Predict and build uses 
`phenix.process_predicted_model <process_predicted_model.html>`_ to estimate 
suitable VRMS values from the pLDDT values in a processed chain to be used 
in molecular replacement (the next step below). The VRMS values are estimates
of the RMSD between the model and the true structure.
Process predicted model first converts average pLDDT to estimated 
RMS error using an empirical formula from RoseTTAFold:

rmsd_est = 1.5 * exp(4*(0.7-pLDDT))  where pLDDT is fractional (0 to 1)

Then it uses a second empirical formula to suggest a value of VRMS based on the RMS error:

vrms = vrms_from_rmsd_slope * rms + vrms_from_rmsd_intercept
where the slope is 1 and intercept is 0.25 A.

Structure determination by molecular replacement (X-ray data)
-------------------------------------------------------------

Predict and build uses `phenix.phaser <phaser.html>`_ with all default
parameters to solve a structure by molecular replacement, except that
the value of VRMS (estimated RMSD between model and true structure)
is estimated from the pLDDT values as described above. You can also
set the value of VRMS directly with the keyword vrms_value.
If your structure
cannot be solved automatically in this way, then you will want to take your
trimmed predicted models, solve your structure separately by molecular 
replacement (e.g., by using `phenix.phaser <phaser.html>`_ but 
changing some parameters), then supplying the molecular replacement model
to Predict and build as a "scaffold model". After molecular replacement,
domains are rearranged if necessary to allow sequential parts to be connected,
creating a scaffold model for use in the morphing step to follow.

The molecular replacement model is refined using the X-ray data, yielding 
a 2mFo-DFc map. This map is density-modified as well, and the map that has
the higher correlation with the refined model is used as the working map.

Structure determination by docking (cryo-EM data)
-------------------------------------------------

Predict and build first carries out density modification based on the two
half-maps that you provide. This creates an optimized map for interpretation.

Predict and build then sequentially docks all the domains from all the 
predicted models into the map.  After docking, the domains are rearranged
if necessary to allow sequential parts to be connected.  This docking is
carried out by `phenix.dock_and_rebuild <dock_and_rebuild.html>`_ . The
rearranged docked model is the scaffold model that will be used in the next step.

Morphing of original predicted models onto the scaffold model
-------------------------------------------------------------

The scaffold model obtained from predicted models and X-ray or cryo-EM maps
usually contains one chain for each sequence in your sequence file.  Your
predicted models normally include one model matching each unique sequence in
the sequence file.  For each chain in the scaffold model, the predicted model
that is most similar is then morphed (adjusted) to superimpose on the
scaffold model.  

In the simplest case, your predicted models all yielded
a single domain in the trimming step. In this case the chains in your scaffold 
model will match your predicted models exactly and morphing consistes of
simple superposition of the full predicted model on the docked chain.  In a
more complicated case, your trimmed model may have consisted of multiple
domains for one chain, so that your scaffold model may have separately-placed
domains for a particular chain. In this case, the morphing consists of 
superimposing the parts of the full predicted model that match the scaffold,
and smoothly deforming the connecting segments.

Model refinement, rebuilding, and trimming
------------------------------------------

Model refinement and rebuilding is done by 
`phenix.dock_and_rebuild <dock_and_rebuild.html>`_ .  This procedure consists
of identifying all the parts of each chain that are either predicted with 
low confidence or that do not match the density, rebuilding them in 
several different ways, and picking the one that matches the density the best.
Then the individual chains are refined with real-space refinement. 

At the end of rebuilding, residues in the model that are in poor density
are identified and marked with zero occupancies.  A new trimmed final model
lacking these residues is also created

For X-ray data, the trimmed model is refined using the X-ray data, yielding a
new working map (2mFo-DFc or density modified, as in the molecular
replacement step).


Iteration of model prediction using the rebuilt models as templates
-------------------------------------------------------------------

A key element of the Predict and build procedure is iteration of model
prediction using chains from the rebuilt model as templates. This 
improves model prediction compared to a single prediction step.  Normally
the entire procedure is repeated until the change in predicted models between
subsequent cycles is small.

Output models
-------------

The results of the Predict and build procedure are:

::

  A final docked model.  This model is the last scaffold model and is 
  normally suitable for use as a reference model in further refinement.
  Normally this model will consist of pure predicted models, 
  placed appropriately to match the map.

  A final trimmed rebuilt model. This model is obtained by rebuilding and 
  refinement, followed by trimming residues that are in poor density.
  It is normally suitable for use as a 
  starting point for further model rebuilding, refinement, and addition of
  ligands and covalent modifications.  A final untrimmed model is also
  provided. This can be used as a hypothesis for the poorly-fitting regions.

  In some cases (low-resolution data), the trimmed rebuilt model may have very
  poor geometry and you might want to use the final docked model as the
  starting point for refinement and continuation of building of your structure.


The Carry-on directory and restarting or re-running jobs
--------------------------------------------------------

Predict and build saves the working files in a carry_on_directory.
At the end of the log file (and in the GUI at the end of a run) the
carry-on directory is listed.  In the GUI it is normally a directory with the
same number as the job and ending in "CarryOn":  for 
PredictAndBuild_30 it is PredictAndBuild_30_CarryOn.
If you have a previous run that you want to restart or continue, specify
the name of this file in the GUI as the Carry-on directory, make sure
the flag "carry_on=True" is set, and rerun the
job with the same inputs (otherwise) as before.
Then running the job will result in reading all the results 
that had been accumulated by the previous job, then continuing from where it
left off.

The carry-on directory lets you restart after stopping or crashing. 
It also lets you
change some parameters and carry on from where you left off.

The jobname also lets you move a project to another computer if you want. You
can copy the carry-on directory and put it in any
directory on any computer. Then you can specify that directory as the
Carry-on directory on that computer and it will carry on from 
where you left off.

Note that the file names inside the Carry-on directory contain
the jobname, so if you want to move individual files around, you might have
to change their names.

The universal solution for (most) problems in PredictAndBuild
-------------------------------------------------------------

The solution to many problems that you may have with PredictAndBuild is simply
to completely stop running your job, then restart, specifying the
Carry-on directory from the job that stopped.
This will pick up where you left off.  It is suitable for cases
where something crashed, where you accidentally stopped a job, where you lost
connections to the server, or where something else went wrong.

In some cases to stop running your job you might have to stop all python 
processes on your computer and quit the GUI, but in most cases you can 
just hit Abort in the GUI and wait a little.

MSA calculation vs model prediction
-----------------------------------

If you use the Phenix server, the calculation of multiple sequence alignments
(MSAs) is a separate step from model prediction.  The Phenix GUI
on your computer sends a request to the mmseqs2 server, which creates an MSA
and sends it back to your computer. Then your computer uploads the MSA to
the Phenix server, which uses it in an AlphaFold prediction.

If you want, you can supply your own MSAs. The key requirement is that the
sequence of the first entry in your MSA must exactly match the sequence to be
predicted.

You can also skip the use of MSAs. This can be useful if you supply a template
and you want AlphaFold to rebuild your template instead of doing a new
prediction.

Number of models
----------------

AlphaFold can carry out multiple predictions for a sequence.  You can specify
how many of these to carry out.  The PredictModel tool will choose the one with
the highest value of pLDDT (predicted local difference distance test).

Using templates from the PDB
----------------------------

You can request that templates from the PDB be used in prediction. If you use
this feature, models will be predicted both with and without the templates, and
the model with the highest pLDDT will be saved.

Using supplied templates
------------------------

You can supply your own templates. As for templates from the PDB, if you use
this feature, models will be predicted both with and without the templates, and
the model with the highest pLDDT will be saved.

Using supplied predictions or RNA/DNA models
--------------------------------------------

You can supply homology models or models that you have built yourself for any
of the chains in your structure.  If you are working with RNA or DNA, you have
to do this.  You just supply a model (does not have to be perfect) for each
chain that you do not want to have AlphaFold predict, and you call it a 
predicted model (note the difference between a template -- a model to guide
AlphaFold prediction, and a predicted model -- the prediction or an alternative
to a prediction.)

For example, suppose you already have a model with 4 DNA chains and four
protein chains called model_ABGH_CDEF.pdb with a sequence file
model_ABGH_CDEF.seq, and you have copied the 4 DNA chains to
model_C.pdb, model_D.pdb, model_E.pdb, and model_F.pdb.  You
can run PredictAndBuild, using the DNA chains as is, and
predicting models for the 4 protein chains (A, B, G, H) like 
this if you have xray data in data.mtz: 

::

    phenix.predict_and_build seq_file=model_ABGH_CDEF.seq \
      scaffold_model=model_ABGH_CDEF.pdb data.mtz \
      control.nproc=4 crystal_info.resolution=2 \
      predicted_model=model_C.pdb \
      predicted_model=model_D.pdb \
      predicted_model=model_E.pdb \
      predicted_model=model_F.pdb

This command will use model_ABGH_CDEF.pdb as a scaffold, superposing
all predicted protein models and the DNA models on it before rebuilding.

Using PredictAndBuild to change the sequences in a model
--------------------------------------------------------

If you have docked (cryo-EM) or placed (X-ray) chains for a structure from
one species using data from another species, you can use PredictAndBuild to
fix all the sequences and create a plausible model for each chain.  

There are several ways you can do this.  If you first run AlphaFold to get
a predicted model for each unique chain, you can
use a command like this:

::

  phenix.predict_and_build predicted_model=replacements.pdb \
 input_files.b_value_field_is=b_value scaffold_model=existing.pdb \
 seq_file=seq.dat cycles=1 refine_only=True refine_cycles=0 \
 crystal_info.resolution=3 full_map=full_map.ccp4

Here existing.pdb is the model you have already created (wrong sequences).
The model replacements.pdb contains your predicted models for each unique
chain, where each predicted model has the right sequence, but can be
in any orientation or position.  The
sequence file seq.dat has all the correct sequences.  The map is required
as it is used to adjust the predicted models. 
The keyword b_value_field_is=b_value tells PredictAndBuild that the predicted
models contain B-values (atomic displacement parameters), not pLDDT values
(predicted Local Difference Distance Test).

If you actually have no map,
you can create a model-based map from your existing.pdb structure with
the `phenix.fmodel <fmodel.html>`_ tool. The map type you want is called
complex (structure factors) and you would want to make it a low-resolution
map (like 10 A).

If you don't want to generate the predicted models yourself, you can skip
that input and just let PredictAndBuild do the predictions.  Of course if you
have RNA or DNA chains, you will need to supply predicted models for those
chains.

Rebuilding a model without prediction (morph and refine only):
--------------------------------------------------------------

You can use predict_and_build to just rebuild a model that is placed (in a
cryo-EM map) like this:

::

  In the GUI, select PredictAndBuild (cryo-EM data)

  Supply:  your map (call it “Map file”), your model (call it 
  “predicted model”), your sequence.

  Just below the inputs there is a line that starts with 
  “Contents of b-value field”… Select “b_value” (not plddt), 
  as this model has B values in its b-value field.

  In Prediction and building settings, go to All parameters, 
  the “Search parameters”, and search for “already”.  Tick 
  the check box for “Models are already placed”.

  In Prediction and building settings, select “Building” and check 
  the box for “Refine only”.

  Hit Run.  It should take your model, morph it to match 
  the map, and refine it.


Examples
--------

Standard run of predict_and_build
---------------------------------

Running predict_and_build is easy. From the command-line you can type:

::

    phenix.predict_and_build jobname=myjob xray_data=my_xray_data.mtz seq_file=seq.dat

This will carry out all the steps of prediction, molecular replacement and
iterative rebuilding and prediction to yield my_model_rebuilt.pdb

If you run again with the same command, Predict and build will read all the previous files and just give you the results.

Common questions
----------------

How long will it take to run?
-----------------------------

Running predict_and_build can take anywhere from an hour to several days,
depending largely on the size of the chains to be placed and the number of
chains.  Increasing the number of processors used (default of 4) will speed
it up. If you are unsure if the program is running, have a look at the log
file, where the status and current time are printed out periodically. Also
you can just see if any Python processes are running on your machine.


R and Rfree values for density modification and for refinement for Xray data
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you are running predict_and_build with Xray data, you will obtain R values
for both density modification and refinement. These are quite different. A good
R value for density modification is in the range of 0.3-0.4, while a good value
for refinement is in the range of 0.2-0.25 for high-resolution data (2 A or
better) and 0.25-0.3 for lower resolution data.


What to do next after predict_and_build?
----------------------------------------

If predict_and_build yields a largely-complete model with reasonable R-value for
X-ray data or reasonable fit to the map with cryo-EM data, the next step is 
usually refinement (phenix.refine for X-ray data or phenix.real_space_refine
for cryo-EM data).  Carry out refinement and iterate with model-building
and validation to further improve your model.  If your structure contains
ligands, once you have a very good model you can use LigandFit to find the
location and orientation of your ligand for either X-ray or cryo-EM data.

Server problems
---------------

The most common problem in running Predict and build is that
the Phenix server is not working as expected.  Normally the first thing
to try is just let the program retry (it will do this for a while normally).

Here is a test you can run to see if everything is ok:
In the GUI, hit AlphaFold/AlphaFold model prediction/Prediction settings/  
and check the box for “Run test job on server and stop”.  Then hit Run. 
In about 10 sec it should say “Test job completed successfully” if everything
is ok.

If the server is still not working, you can take the files in the packaged
.tgz file (listed in the GUI output), use them to get your own prediction with
any server, and put the resulting predicted models in the place specified in 
the GUI or program output.


Problems with low-confidence models
-----------------------------------

If your predicted models have low confidence, the entire procedure may not work.

If the resolution of your data is about 4.5 A or better, and most of most of 
your predicted models have high confidence (plDDT > 70), then
the procedure has a good chance of working. Otherwise, the chances are lower.

Symmetry problems
-----------------

If your cryo-EM map has pseudo-symmetry (like a proteasome) you might need 
to box one subunit or try ssm_search=False to use a more thorough search 
in docking.

Working on individual chains in large cryo-EM structures
--------------------------------------------------------

If you are working with a large cryo-EM structure (or even a small one),
you may find it
most efficient to break up the work into small pieces.  If you can identify
where individual chains are in your map, you can box around each chain, 
creating individual boxes for each chain to work on. One way to create
a box around a chain is to put a dummy molecule in the density you are 
interested (anything that more or less covers the region you want), then
use the `MapBox <map_box.html>`_ tool to create a little map surrounding 
that dummy molecule.  

When you use the `MapBox <map_box.html>`_ tool be
sure to use the defaults and do not shift the origin (if you shift the origin
then the models you get will not superimpose on the original map).

Then of course you have to guess which sequence goes with that density. You
could try a few possibilites and run PredictAndBuild on your small map with
each likely sequence.

When you are done with each box, you can just combine all the models because
they will stay in their correct locations.

Inverted map:
-------------

If your map is inverted (left-handed), docking and model-building will not 
work properly. You can often tell if your map is inverted because any 
helices will be left-handed.  If you are unsure, you can run MapBox with 
invert_hand=True to invert the map and then see if docking works.  Note that 
if your map is inverted, you will want to invert all your maps and start 
everything from the beginning.

Specific limitations and problems:
----------------------------------

AlphaFold only predicts protein structures, not RNA or DNA, so you will have to
either build those chains separately or supply predicted models (homology 
models, for example) for those chains. If you supply predicted models for some 
chains and not others, predict_and_build will try to predict the missing
chains and build with all the available models. 

The predict_and_build tool has two command-line parameters for nproc 
(prediction.nproc and control.nproc), two for resolution
(prediction.resolution and crystal_info.resolution), and two for random_seed
(prediction.random_seed and control.random_seed).
Normally use the control.nproc, crystal_info.resolution and 
control.random_seed parameters.  However if you want to change the number
of processors (on the server, nproc only used for getting templates 
with structure_search and limited to 4 processors) you can set prediction.nproc.
If you want to set the random seed used in prediction to a particular value
you can set prediction.random_seed (and also usually set
use_supplied_random_seed_in_prediction=True).
