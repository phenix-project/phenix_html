mmtbx.prepare_pdb_deposition
============================

Description
-----------

This tool is primarily for adding sequence information to the mmCIF output from
phenix.refine to make the file suitable for deposition into the Protein Data
Bank. The minimum inputs for this use case are the model from phenix.refine and
a sequence file.

If you are starting with a model in PDB format, we recommended that you run
phenix.refine on your model and data to generate the necessary fields related
to the data, then run this tool to add the sequence information. If your model
contains ligands, additional restraints files for the ligands may be necessary.

The input sequence should just be the one letter canonical sequence. For non-standard
amino acids or residues, this tool will replace the one letter code with the
three letter code surrounded by the parentheses. For example, if there is a
selenomethionine, your input sequence should represent that residue as "M". This
tool will replace the "M" with "(MSE)" in the correct field in the output
mmCIF file.

However, this feature is dependent on curated monomer libraries, so if there is
an ambiguity in the parent residue (e.g. methionine is the parent residue for
selenomethionine), the conversion will not be automatic. For this situation, you
can manually specify which residues to convert from the one letter code to the
three letter code with the "custom_residues" parameter. You just need to provide
a space-separated sequence of residues. Two examples where this is necessary are
SUI in PDB code 2jjj and OTY in PDB code 4jye.


Command line usage examples
