phenix.dynamics: simple model perturbation
==========================================

This program performs very crude molecular dynamics on a model, usually for
the purpose of removing any bias in R-free due to previous refinement against
a different test set.  **It is not suitable for generating physically realistic
trajectories**, due to the lack of attractive forces such as electrostatics,
and lengthy runs will result in the model falling apart.  However, it is very
effective for de-biasing while maintaining approximately correct geometry, and
is also very fast (unlike simulated annealing in `phenix.refine
<refine_gui.html>`__).

The inputs for the program are very similar to those for
`phenix.geometry_minimization <geometry_minimization.html>`__; the only
required files are a model and any necessary restraints (CIF) files for
non-standard ligands.  By default the dynamics is run at approximately room
temperature; higher temperatures will result in faster movement.  Note however
that unlike simulated annealing, the model will tend to unfold rapidly at
high temperatures.

Alternatives and complementary programs
---------------------------------------

  - Simulated annealing has some advantages due to the ability to
    simultaneously de-bias and optimize the model against the data, which
    prevents the structure from unfolding at high temperatures.  The
    main disadvantage is the much longer runtime.
  - `phenix.pdbtools <pdbtools.html>`__ can be used to reset B-factors, or
    shake coordiantes without geometry restraints.  The latter is redundant
    if dynamics is run, but setting the B-factors to suitably low starting
    values (approximately 10 for most resolutions) will help remove bias.
  - Both of the above steps can also be run at the start of `phenix.refine
    <refine_gui.html>`_; click the "Modify start model" button in the GUI
    to access options.
  - To perturb structures for use as molecular replacement models, there is
    a separate program providing an interface to the normal modes method in
    Phaser (also available in the GUI under "Model tools").  This does a
    better job conserving local structure.
