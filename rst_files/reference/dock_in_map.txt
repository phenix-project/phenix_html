Purpose
-------

The routine dock_in_map will automatically dock a model or models into a map.

Usage
-----

How dock_in_map works:
----------------------

Dock-in-map uses a convolution-based shape search to find a part of a map
that is similar to the model.  The key elements of the search are:

::

  Initial search at lower resolution that focuses on overall shape of the
  molecule.  This allows a quick search but is less effective if the
  map contains more than one molecule

  Initial search without rotation.  This allows a fast search that can place
  a molecule that is just shifted by a translation

  Optional initial search based on matching moments of inertia of model and map.
  This is also a fast search but requires an accurate map that looks a lot
  like the model and does not have extra density.

  Full search at the full resolution of the map.  This search can be run on
  multiple processors to speed it up.

Uses
----

You can use dock_in_map to place any number of copies of any number of unique
molecules.  You specify the molecules one by one:

::

  search_model=model1.pdb
  search_model=model2.pdb
  search_model=model3.pdb

and the number of copies all at once with:

::

   search_model_copies="3 1 2"

to look for 3 copies of model1.pdb, one of model2.pdb and two of model3.pdb.

You can also use dock_in_map to superimpose density from one map on another 
map. You just specify the second map with the density:

::

  search_map_file=map_file.ccp4

and dock_in_map will find the density in this map, convert it to a pseudo-model
that corresponds to this density, and then search for the pseudo-model just as
any other model.  When dock_in_map is done finding the pseudo-model, it applies
the transformation that it found to the original density in your search_map_file
to create a new map that superimposes on the target map.

Examples
--------

Standard run of dock_in_map:
----------------------------

Running dock_in_map is easy. From the command-line you can type:

::

  phenix.dock_in_map 1ss8_A.pdb emd_8750.map resolution=4 nproc=4 \
     pdb_out=placed_model_from_emd_8750.pdb

where 1ss8_A.pdb is the model you would like to place, 
emd_8750.map is a CCP4, mrc or other related map format, and you 
specify the nominal resolution of the map and the number of processors to use.

For docking density into a map:


  phenix.dock_in_map emd_8750.map density.ccp4 resolution=4 \
    superposed_map_file=density_superposed.ccp4
