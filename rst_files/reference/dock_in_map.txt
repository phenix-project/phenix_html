Docking a model into a cryo-EM map with dock_in_map

Purpose
-------

The routine dock_in_map will automatically dock a model or models into a map.

Usage
-----

How dock_in_map works:
----------------------

Dock-in-map uses a convolution-based shape search to find a part of a map
that is similar to the model.  The key elements of the search are:

::

  Initial search at lower resolution that focuses on overall shape of the
  molecule.  This allows a quick search but is less effective if the
  map contains more than one molecule

  Initial search without rotation.  This allows a fast search that can place
  a molecule that is just shifted by a translation

  Optional initial search based on matching moments of inertia of model and map.
  This is also a fast search but requires an accurate map that looks a lot
  like the model and does not have extra density.

  Full search at the full resolution of the map.  This search can be run on
  multiple processors to speed it up.


Examples
--------

Standard run of dock_in_map:
----------------------------

Running dock_in_map is easy. From the command-line you can type:

::

  phenix.dock_in_map 1ss8_A.pdb emd_8750.map resolution=4 nproc=4 \
     pdb_out=placed_model_from_emd_8750.pdb

where 1ss8_A.pdb is the model you would like to place, 
emd_8750.map is a CCP4, mrc or other related map format, and you 
specify the nominal resolution of the map and the number of processors to use.
