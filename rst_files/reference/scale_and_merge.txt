Purpose
-------

scale_and_merge is a tool for scaling unmerged anomalous data or multiple
data files and creating a scaled dataset and two scaled half-datasets.
This tool normally is used in combination with anomalous\_signal to 
create a scaled dataset and analyze anomalous signal in a SAD dataset. It
can also be used to scale any other group of datasets.

Usage
-----

How scale_and_merge works:
--------------------------

-  You supply scale_and_merge with a directory containing datafiles or
   the name of a single unmerged datafile.

-  You can optionally also specify a pair of labels that identifies datasets
   that are to be kept together. For example if you collected your data
   as pairs of datafiles with inverse beam geometry, you might have called
   the members of a pair data_1_0_w1.HKL and data_1_0_w2.HKL, related by 
   w1 and w2.

-  scale_and_merge will first check the cell dimensions of all the datasets.
   Normally it will choose the largest set of similar crystals (you can 
   have it keep all datasets with only_similar_datasets=False). It will also
   check the anisotropy in all the datafiles and calculate the average
   anisotropy (to be applied by default to all datafiles before scaling).
   
-  scale_and_merge will then scale all the data together.  It will 
   split your datafiles into smaller files if your datafiles contain duplicate
   measurements of the same indices.  The intensities in each datafile will
   be adjusted for anisotropy to match the average anisotropy of
   all the datafiles. In this way all the datafiles are matched but the overall
   character of the data is not changed.  

-  scale_and_merge will then scale each individual file with local scaling,
   producing files in the temporary directory with names ending in _scale.mtz.
   and then merge them all together. 

-  Merging of the individual datasets is done twice, and then optionally
   two additional times to optimize anomalous differences.

-  In the first merging the individual datasets are simply averaged with weights
   based on the sigmas for each reflection. Then the individual datasets are
   compared with the overall mean dataset and dataset variances (estimates
   of systematic differences between datasets and the mean) are calculated
   based on the rms differences from the mean and the individual sigmas. In
   essence the dataset variance plus the individual variances are then to be
   used as estimates of the total variance for each reflection.  The second
   merging uses these total variances in weighting rather than the 
   original sigmas. The correlations of each individual dataset with the 
   merged dataset are calculated. 

-  If anomalous differences are optimized 
   (default with optimize_anomalous=True), merging is carried
   out another time in order to optimize the weighting of anomalous differences
   in the merging step.  For each unique reflection in the asymmetric unit of
   each dataset, the mean I+ and mean I- are used to calculate anomalous 
   differences.  The anomalous differences from each individual dataset are
   then compared with the anomalous differences from the merged dataset to
   estimate individual dataset anomalous difference variances.  Then
   the anomalous differences from each individual dataset
   are averaged, with weights based on the original sigmas and the
   dataset variances.  These merged anomalous differences are then used to
   replace the anomalous differences in the merged dataset above (for 
   example, a reflection in the merged dataset above that has I+,sigI+,I-,sigI-
   would get new values of I+ and I- that have a difference equal to the
   appropriate merged anomalous difference, but the same mean as before.)
   The correlation of the anomalous differences in the original merged
   dataset and after optimization is printed (this should be high, for 
   example 0.80).

-  The original datasets are then split into two parts for creation of
   two half-datasets.  These half-datasets are useful for estimating the
   quality of the data and are used in anomalous_signal for this purpose.

-  The splitting into half-datasets is done in one of three ways, and
   the method is chosen based on the number of anomalous differences available
   for comparison using each method.  With each method the data in each
   half-dataset are scaled just as the entire dataset was scaled.
   The preferred method is to split by files.  Half of the datafiles are 
   used to create each half-dataset.  The next preferred method is to split
   with the first half of each dataset in one half-dataset and the second half
   in the other.  The third preferred method is splitting alternate reflections
   with each unique index (after mapping to the asymmetric unit) into the
   two half-datasets.  The last method is to randomly assign reflections to
   the two half-datasets.  The reason for this hierarchical approach is that
   reflections measured close in time, within the same dataset are better
   matched than those measured further in time or within different datasets.
   These approaches for splitting the datafiles attempt to pair anomalous
   differences measured close in time and in the same dataset.

-  After half-datasets are obtained, the correlation of anomalous differences
   between half-datasets is estimated.
