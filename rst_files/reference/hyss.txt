HySS overview
=============

The HySS (Hybrid Substructure Search) submodule of the Phenix package
is a highly-automated procedure for the location of anomalous
scatterers in macromolecular structures. HySS starts with the
automatic detection of the reflection file format and analyses all
available datasets in a given reflection file to decide which of these
is best suited for solving the structure. The search parameters are
automatically adjusted based on the available data and the number of
expected sites given by the user. The search method is a systematic
multi-trial procedure employing

  - direct-space Patterson interpretation followed by
  - reciprocal-space Patterson interpretation followed by
  - dual-space direct methods or Phaser LLG completion followed by
  - automatic comparison of the solutions and
  - automatic termination detection.

The end result is a *consensus model* which is exported in a variety of
file formats suitable for frequently used phasing and density
modification packages.

The core search procedure is applicable to both anomalous diffraction
and isomorphous replacement problems. However, currently the command
line interface is limited to work with anomalous diffraction data
or *externally* preprocessed difference data.

A new powerful and parallel Hybrid Substructure Search (HySS)
=============================================================

HySS has many new features since 2014.  The first thing you might notice in
HySS is that it can use as many processors as you have on your computer.
This can make for a really quick direct methods search for your
anomalously-scattering substructure.

You might notice next that for SAD data
HySS now automatically tries Phaser completion
to find a solution if the direct methods approach does not give a clear
solution right away.  Phaser completion uses the SAD likelihood function to
create an LLG map that is used to find additional sites and then scores
the solutions with the likelihood function.  This is really
great because Phaser completion in HySS can be much more powerful than
direct methods in HySS. Phaser completion takes a lot longer than direct
methods completion but it is now quite feasible, particularly if you have
several processors on your computer.

The next thing you might notice in HySS is that it automatically tries
several resolution cutoffs for the searches if the first try does not
give a convincing solution.  Also HySS will start out with a few Patterson
seeds and then try more if that doesn't give a clear solution.

HySS now considers a solution convincing if it finds the same solution
several times, starting with different initial Patterson peaks as seeds.
The more sites in the solution, the fewer duplicates need to be found to
have a convincing solution.

Putting all these together, the new HySS is much faster than the old HySS and it can solve substructures that the old HySS could not touch.


Graphical interface
===================

The HySS GUI is listed in the "Experimental phasing" category of the main
PHENIX GUI.  Most options are shown in the main window, but only the fields
highlighted below are mandatory.  The data labels will be selected
automatically if the reflections file contains anomalous arrays, and any
symmetry information present in the file will be loaded in the unit cell and
space group fields.

It may be helpful to run Xtriage first to determine an appropriate high
resolution cutoff, as most datasets do not have significant anomalous signal
in the highest resolution shells.  The wavelength is only required if Phaser
is being used for rescoring.  Additional options are described below in
the command-line documentation.

At the end of the run, a tab will be added showing output files and basic
statistics.  A correlation coefficient of XXX usually indicates that the sites
are real.  If you are happy with the sites, you can load them into
`AutoSol <autosol_gui.html>`__ or `Phaser <phaser_ep.txt>`__ directly from this
window.

A full list on sites is displayed in the "Edit sites" tab.  For a typical
high-quality selenomethionine dataset, such as the p9-sad tutorial data used
here, valid sites should have an occupancy close to 1, but for certain types
of heavy-atom soaks (such as bromine) all sites may have partial occupancy.
You can edit the sites by changing the occupancy or unchecking any that you
wish to discard, then clicking the "Save selected" button.

Command line options
====================

Enter ``phenix.hyss`` without arguments to obtain a list of the available
command line options::

  usage: phenix.hyss [options] reflection_file n_sites element_symbol

  Example: phenix.hyss w1.sca 66 Se



Trying a search without automatic termination
=============================================

If the HySS consensus model does not lead to an interpretable electron
density map you can try the ``search=full`` option::

  phenix.hyss your_file.sca 100 se search full

This disables the automatic termination detection and the run will in
general take considerably longer. If the full search leads to a better
consensus model please let us know because we will want to improve the
automatic termination detection.

Brute-force searches
====================

A second option in cases where HySS does not find a solution
is to try is the ``strategy=brute-force`` option. The
brute-force approach uses Phaser LLG completion and likelihood scoring as
in a standard run of HySS with SAD data, except that instead of adding
the highest set of sites from the LLG map as a group, all combinations
of the top 20 or so sites are taken two at a time to form new trial solutions.
These are all then used in LLG completion and scoring as well.  The process
takes quite a long time and you would normally use it only if you have
a multiprocessor machine.

To carry out a very extensive search with brute force, you may want to adjust
the parameters ``n_top_patt`` (target number of Patterson seeds to consider),
``n_top_patt_min`` (minimum number of seeds to consider, normally the search is
terminated when the target number of sites is found once n_top_patt_min seeds
have been examined), and ``n_top_llg`` (number of sites from LLG map to
consider for each seed.)

Varying the high-resolution limit
=====================================

Another possibility is to override the automatic determination of the
high-resolution limit with the ``resolution`` option. In some cases
the resolution limit is very critical. Truncating the high-resolution
limit of the data can sometimes lead to a successful search, as
more reflections with a weak anomalous signal are excluded.

Trying likelihood-based rescoring with direct methods
=====================================================

You can use likelihood-based rescoring along with direct methods.
For this procedure, the keyword ``rescore=phaser-complete`` is recommended.
This approach is less affected by
suboptimal resolution cutoffs and also provides more discrimination with noisy
data. Switching on the ``phaser-map`` extrapolation protocol is also worthwhile,
since it increases success rate and is only a small runtime overhead compared
to phaser-based rescoring.

Searches for heavy-atom cluster compounds
=========================================

You can search for cluster compounds with HySS.
Normally you should supply a PDB file with an example of the cluster using the keyword cluster_compound_structure=my_cluster_compound.pdb and scattering_type=XX  (yes, really the two letters XX, not XX replaced by some other name). 
If your cluster is Ta6Br12 then you can simply put scattering_type=TX and skip the PDB file. 

Notes
=====

The ``site_min_distance``, ``site_min_distance_sym_equiv``, and
``site_min_cross_distance`` options are available to override the
default minimum distance of 3.5 Angstroms between substructure sites.

The ``real_space_squaring`` option can be useful for large structures
with high-resolution data. In this case the large number of triplets
generated for the reciprocal-space direct methods procedure (i.e. the
tangent formula) may lead to excessive memory allocation. By default
HySS switches to real-space direct methods (i.e. E-map squaring) if it
searches for more than 100 sites. If this limit is too high given the
available memory use the ``real_space_squaring`` option. For
substructures with a large number of sites it is in our experience not
critical to employ reciprocal-space direct methods.

If the ``molecular_weight`` and ``solvent_content`` options are
used HySS will help in determining the number of substructures sites in
the unit cell, interpreting the number of sites specified on the
command line as number of sites per molecule. For example::

  phenix.hyss gere_MAD.mtz 2 se molecular_weight=8000 solvent_content=0.70

This is telling HySS that we have a molecule with a molecular weight
of 8 kD, a crystal with an estimated solvent content of 70%, and that
we expect to find 2 Se sites per molecule. The HySS output will now
show the following::

  #---------------------------------------------------------------------------#
  | Formula for calculating the number of molecules given a molecular weight. |
  |---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
  | n_mol = ((1.0-solvent_content)*v_cell)/(molecular_weight*n_sym*.783)      |
  #---------------------------------------------------------------------------#
  Number of molecules: 6
  Number of sites: 12
  Values used in calculation:
    Solvent content: 0.70
    Unit cell volume: 476839
    Molecular weight: 8000.00
    Number of symmetry operators: 4

HySS will go on searching for 12 sites.

Auxiliary programs
==================

phenix.emma
-----------

*EMMA* stands for *Euclidean Model Matching* which allows two sets of
coordinates to be superimposed as best as possible given symmetry and
origin choices. See the `phenix.emma <emma.html>`_ documentation for
more details.
