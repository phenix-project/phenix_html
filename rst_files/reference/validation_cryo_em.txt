Cryo-EM Validation tools in Phenix
==================================

.. contents::

Overview
========

Phenix has multiple tools for validating cryo-EM maps and models. They are
combined into a single tool called ``phenix.validation_cryoem``. This can be run
in the GUI by selecting "Comprehensive Validation (cryo-EM)" either from the
"Validation" section or the "Cryo-EM" section.

Opening the program will show a window for supplying your input files and basic
settings.

.. image:: ../images/validation_cryoem_input.png

You will need at least a model and one map. If you provide half maps, be sure to
indicate which map is the full map and which maps are the half maps. To do so,
after adding the files, you can right-click on the row of a map file and select
either "Full map" or "Half map."

Lastly, before running the program, enter the resolution of the map.

**Important note:** The default scattering table for cryo-EM tools is "electron."
A consequence of this setting is that Phenix does not have electron scattering
factors for ions. You may get error messages if your cryo-EM structures have ions.

Once the program finishes the analysis, you will get a page that summarizes all
the results, as well as additional pages for more detailed information about each
section.

Similar to the "Comprehensive Validation (X-ray/Neutron)" GUI, the model and map
can be viewed in Coot and the pages with more detail information will allow you
to zoom into the more problematic areas of your structure.

There is also a button, "Export Table 1," for exporting the summary statistics
into plain text, comma separated text, or rich-text format.


Model
=====

This page contains the model-related metrics with additional pages for each
major metric.

Generally, clicking on a row of a table or clicking a point in the graph

.. image:: ../images/validation_cryoem_ile.png

will zoom in on that particular atom/residue in Coot.

The results are subdivided into several categories listed below.

 - **Clashes:** this shows areas of the structure where atoms may be too close to
   each other. In Coot, this is shown by red dots.
 - **CaBLAM:** this is the output from `phenix.cablam <cablam_validation.html>`_,
   which looks at several measures based on the geometry of the C-|agr| atoms.
 - **C**\ |bgr|: this looks for any deviations in the C-|bgr| atoms.
 - **Cis/Twisted:** Cis peptides are generally rare (~5% of prolines and ~0.03%
   of other residues), so make sure that a cis conformation is really supported
   by the map. Twisted peptides are almost always incorrect.
 - **Rotamers:** this checks that the sidechains are in the expected regions
   according to compiled distributions of the |KHgr|-angles in the Top8000
   database.
 - **Ramachandran:** this checks that the dihedral angles of the protein residues
   are in the expected regions according to the Top8000 database.
 - **Geometry restraints:** this checks that the bond lengths, bond angles,
   dihedral angles, and other geometric restraints do not deviate too much from
   the mean value.

Model and Data Fit
==================

This page shows how well the model fits into the map by calculating different
correlation coefficients. Please check the `first reference
<https://doi.org/10.1107/S2059798318009324>`_ for a more detailed
description of each correlation coefficient (CC). Table 3 from the reference is
reproduced below.

CC\ :sub:`vr_mask` Same as CC\ :sub:`mask` but atomic radii are variable and function of resolution, atom type and ADP Fit of the atomic images in the given map
================== =================================================================================================== =======================================================

Correlation coefficients per chain and per residue are also shown in plots.

.. image:: ../images/validation_cryoem_mvd.png

The per residue plot is shown for a single chain. To change the chain, you can
click on the per chain plot or use the drop down menu. Clicking on the per
residue plot will center on the residue in Coot.
