Automated protein-ligand structure determination with phenix.ligand_pipeline
============================================================================

Overview
--------

``phenix.ligand_pipeline`` is an automation system combining `Xtriage
<xtriage.html>`_, `Phaser <mr_overview.html>`_, `eLBOW <elbow.html>`_,
`phenix.refine <refinement.html>`_, `AutoBuild <autobuild.html>`_, and
`LigandFit <ligandfit.html>`_, with optional interaction with `Coot
<../coot.html>`_.  In favorable cases, it can produce a near-finished structure
of a protein-ligand complex starting from minimal inputs, and can significantly
reduce the manual effort required for more difficult structures.

Input files
-----------

The typical input for the pipeline consists of processed experimental data,
a starting model for molecular replacement, a sequence file equivalent to the
starting model (with the same number of chains), and a source of ligand
information.  File types will be automatically detected if explicit parameter
names are not used, for instance::

  phenix.ligand_pipeline model.pdb data.mtz seq.fa lig.cif

The data may be in any format; if R-free flags are not found they will be
generated automatically, but you may also supply the flags in a separate file
(``r_free_flags.file_name=flags.mtz``).  This is espeically recommended if you
are working with multiple isomorphous structures.  The sequence file is
optional but highly recommended.

To specify the ligand geometry, several mutually exclusive options are
available:

- Chemical file, such as MOL2, CIF (this can include existing
  restraints), or SMILES: ``ligand=lig.cif``

- SMILES string: ``ligand_smiles=c1ccccc1``

- For ligands already present in the PDB, if you know the three-letter code
  used, you may specify this instead: ``ligand_code=ATP``

It is recommended that you use the most detailed and explicit information about
the ligand chemistry and geometry that you have available: a pre-generated and
manually validated CIF is ideal.
You may also supply a PDB file (``template_pdb=lig.pdb``) containing the atom
names to use.  However, PDB files should **not** be the primary source of
ligand geometry information!  Additionally, if you have additional ligands in
your input model, you can supply CIF files for refinement with the ``extra_cif``
keyword.  You should also specify ``keep_hetatms=True`` to prevent Phaser
from resetting the occupancies to zero.

Finally, if all files are in the same directory and their uses can be
unambiguously determined, you may supply the path name as a single argument
when launching the program::

  phenix.ligand_pipeline /path/to/data [options]


Program workflow
----------------

**Data preparation**.  The program begins by importing the experimental data
and converting it to amplitudes with standard MTZ column labels (this
simplifies later steps).  R-free flags will be generated if not available,
otherwise the user-supplied flags will be used (extended to higher resolution
if necessary).  Xtriage will be run to assess data quality and guess an
appropriate number of search copies for MR (which, by default, will be the
same as the number of ligands to look for).

**Ligand generation**.  eLBOW will be run on the input ligand definition to
generate suitable geometry restraints and a starting structure for LigandFit.
The most important option is the choice of whether to run the semi-empirical
AM1 quantum-mechanical optimization or
not (``optimize=True``).  This is not done by default because it is more
time-consuming, but in some cases it may lead to improved geometry.  For
troublesome cases, we recommend generating the ligand restraints and structure
manually prior to running the pipeline, then supplying the output CIF as
input to the pipeline with the additional argument
``keep_input_restraints=True``.  In this case, eBLOW will only be used to
generate a PDB file, and the input restraints will be used for refinement.

**Model preparation**.  For each input model, a series of cleanup steps is
run to remove specific details such as alternate conformations, hydrogen atoms,
or waters.  The model will also be processed
with `Sculptor <sculptor.html>`_ to ensure that all residues match the target
sequence.  (This will not extend truncated sidechains, but this is available
as a later step after ligand placement.)

**Model placement**.  Two options are available, rigid-body refinement or
molecular replacement:

- **Molecular replacement**.  This uses the full MR_AUTO mode in Phaser, which
  includes rigid-body and group B-factor refinement (although the B-factors
  are not output).  The number of search
  copies will be determined automatically by Xtriage (``copies=Auto``), but
  since this will occasionally guess too few copies, you can explicitly set
  the search number instead (e.g. ``copies=2``).  If Phaser finds fewer copies
  than expected, the number of expected ligands will automatically be adjusted.
  Non-water heteroatoms will be preserved at their original occupancies.
  If you want to preserve a specific placement or orientation of the MR
  solution, you can specify a previously determined model by passing the
  reference_structure parameter.
- **Rigid-body refinement**.  If the input model is already close enough to
  the target structure, rigid-body refinement alone will be suitable.

Currently MR is run by default, but this will be changed in the future; if 
you are confident that the model can be correctly placed without MR, add
``mr=False`` or ``skip_mr=True`` or ``--skip_mr`` to jump straight to
refinement.  (This will automatically turn on rigid-body refinement in the
subsequent step.)  A more useful (but slightly slower) option is ``mr=Auto``,
which will attempt rigid-body refinement and then revert to running Phaser
if the R-free is greater than 0.4 or no models with appropriate symmetry are
found.

In automatic or MR mode, you may specify multiple models as input; the best
model will be selected either by Phaser or the rigid-body refinement step.
The space group will be updated based on the Phaser solution or selected model
if necessary.

**Initial refinement**.  The MR solution (or starting model, if MR was not
performed) will be refined using a relatively conservative resolution-dependent
strategy, by default rotamer fitting,
real-space and reciprocal-space coordinate minimization, individual B-factor
refinement, and TLS groups.  Torsion NCS will be used if appropriate.
Rigid-body refinement will be used if Phaser was not previously run.  Water
molecules will be added if the resolution is sufficient, but these will be
removed prior to ligand fitting.  Simulated annealing may be run
if desired (``anneal=True``), but this will significantly increase the
runtime.  Because rapid convergence is more important at this point than
ideal geometry, weight optimization will not be used by default.  (Water
picking is used because this improves the maps, but the solvent atoms will be
removed prior to ligand fitting to avoid overlap.)

If the refined R-free is above 0.5, the program will immediately exit, since
this indicates that the structure may be incorrect or at least in need of
extensive manual rebuilding (or possibly additional search copies for MR).  If
R-free is above 0.3, the default behavior (``build=Auto``) is to rebuild the
model in AutoBuild.  Otherwise, the structure is considered suitable for
ligand fitting.

**Rebuilding**.  Rebuilding is optional but may be essential in some cases
where large rearrangements are required.  AutoBuild will be run with
rebuild_in_place=Auto, which in most cases means that residues will not be
added or removed.  If run, AutoBuild is generally the most time-consuming
stage in the pipeline, although it can take advantage of multiple processors.

An alternate protocol, run by default, is to simply delete those residues with
poor fit to density, with the goal of moving them out of the way of the ligand
binding site.  Either the mainchain or sidechain atoms or both can be removed,
but the default is to only prune sidechains.  These may optionally be rebuilt
after the ligand is placed.

As a final preparation step, waters are removed from the model and the
difference map is recalculated.

**Ligand placement**.  Currently only LigandFit is supported, although
additional options will be available in the future.  The target map will be
the mFo-DFc map from phenix.refine.  The parameters have been adjusted slightly
for optimal performance at the expense of slightly longer runtime; you may
specify ``quick=True`` or ``aggressive=True`` to override the defaults.
Real-space refinement will be performed on ligands after placement to obtain
an optimized fit and local geometry.  Unlike most of the other steps, here the
resolution will be truncated by default to 1.8Å (``ligandfit.d_min=1.8``),
because higher-resolution data tend to lead to lower correlations even when
the fit is excellent.

An essential feature of automatic ligand fitting is a cutoff model-to-map CC
to prevent false positives (i.e. spurious placement).  By default this is set
to 0.7, which has been empirically determined to nearly always indicate a
successful fit.  Any ligands with a CC below this value will be omitted from
the model.  In some cases this may actually reject correct fits (see
Troubleshooting section below), but we recommend that these solutions be
viewed with suspicion.  If no acceptable ligand fits are obtained, the
pipeline will skip further refinement and exit early with an error message.

In many cases the one or more ligands will be placed, but fewer than the
desired number; in these situations, a separate post-LigandFit routine will
first attempt to use NCS operators to place additional copies of the ligand,
pruning the model as necessary to avoid clashes.  If there are still fewer
copies than desired, the pipeline will continue with refinement but print a
warning at the end of the run.

**Final refinement and validation**.  If the ligand placement was at least
partially successful, a final round of refinement will be performed on the
combined model.  In this run, waters will be added automatically if the
resolution is at least 2.9Å, and the geometry weight will be optimized if the
resolution is worse than 1.75Å (this is much slower but can run on multiple
processors, and generally produces a superior model).

Interactive mode
----------------

For users desiring more control over the rebuilding process, or for difficult
cases where more aggressive model modifications are required, the program can
be run semi-interactively by adding the flag ``interactive=True`` (or
alternately, ``--interactive``).  This will launch Coot after the first
round of refinement, with model and maps loaded, allowing rebuilding to take
place.  The recommended procedure is to locate the putative ligand density
in the mFo-DFc map, and adjust the protein structure as necessary to remove
overlap with the ligand binding site (as well as any other modifications
that will not be automatically fixed by refinement and/or AutoBuild).  Once
rebuilding is complete, click the button "Return to PHENIX" to save the
edited model and resume the pipeline (the next step will be LigandFit, with
a freshly calculated mFo-DFc map).  At any point during rebuilding, you can
obtain new maps for the edited model by clicking "Fetch new maps" on the
toolbar, which will write out a temporary model and recalculate maps in the
background, automatically loading these into Coot when finished.

Because the interactive mode overcomes many of the limitations present when
significant rebuilding is required, it is the reocmmended method for running
the pipeline, especially for new users.

Output files
------------

All files will be written to a directory named ``pipeline_X``, where X is
an automatically incremented integer.  Most of the important output files will
be named after the ligand code, by default LIG:

- ``LIG_data.mtz``: filtered data and R-free flags
- ``LIG_final.pdb``: final output model
- ``LIG_final.mtz``: final map coefficients (as well as data and flags)
- ``LIG_ligand.cif``: ligand geometry restraints
- ``pipeline.log``: log file for the entire run
- ``visualize_coot.py``: script for loading results in Coot

The Coot script can be run like this:

  coot --script pipeline_1/visualize_coot.py

This will open the final model and map coefficients, and if ligand fitting
was successful, a window will be created containing buttons to zoom in on
the ligand(s).

Inside the output directory, separate subdirectories will be created for each
stage of the pipeline, e.g. ``phaser_0``, ``refine_0``, ``refine_1``,
``LigandFit_run_1_``.  You do not normally need any of the files in these
directories, but they may be useful for debugging purposes.  In particular,
if LigandFit failed to place one or more copies, the ligand PDB files will not
be incorporated into the final model, but will still be available in the
LigandFit output directory.

Next steps
----------

Although the pipeline can produce nearly-complete models in favorable cases
(typically at moderate-to-high resolution, approximately 2.2 to 1.8Å), the
structures are unlikely to be truly complete.  Several recommendations for
finishing the refinement in Coot:

- **Inspect the ligand binding closely.** A number of structures in the PDB
  have been shown to exhibit ligand placements which are not supported by
  the data, leading to several retractions so far.  Although the CC cutoff
  for ligand placement is designed to avoid this outcome, **it is essential
  that you visually confirm the refined ligand position.**  Of particular
  concern:

    - Does the difference map show residual positive or (especially) negative
      peaks around the ligand binding site?  Even if the overall position is
      approximately correct, this may indicate problems with the specific
      conformation and/or geometry; it is not uncommon, for example, for
      nearly-symmetric rings to be fit backwards.

    - Does the overall shape of the 2mFo-DFc map approximate that of the
      ligand?  If not, this could mean that the ligand has been mistakenly
      placed in density for missing protein atoms, or for another unrelated
      ligand (such as contaminants from the crystallization solution).  Note
      that it is quite possible for flexible ligands to be partially
      disordered, but in such cases the majority of the ligand should still
      be clearly defined in the map.

    - Does the binding make biological sense?  Pay special attention to
      hydrogen bond donors and acceptors in both the ligand and the protein,
      and especially the interactions of charged groups.  Chemically
      nonsensical binding usually indicates an incorrect fit (or, in extreme
      cases, an incorrect ligand).

- **Look for additional ligands.** It is quite common for protein structures
  to co-crystallize with buffer molecules, ions, and endogenous contaminants.
  These can be placed by running LigandFit, or interactively in Coot.

- **Check for errors or missing pieces in the protein model.** Even after
  refinement and/or rebuilding, some local fitting problems may be present
  (especially at lower resolution).  Additionally, it is very common for
  pieces of the start model to be missing from the refined structure, or
  vice-versa; this will usually be obvious from the maps.  Alternate
  conformations will normally be stripped out before molecular replacement,
  so at high resolution (typically 1.6Å or better), these may need to be
  added manually.  You should also check the validation results to identify
  geometry problems and misfitting.

- If none of the above steps requires further adjustments, your model is
  probably complete.  Otherwise, if you make any changes, you should run a
  final round of refinement with weight optimization to get the best possible
  model, and a final set of maps which should also be inspected.

More generally, with any automation system, two rules apply: **exercise
appropriate skepticism** and **seek expert opinion if unsure of the results**.
(If a local expert is not available, email help@phenix-online.org for advice.)

Limitations
-----------

- For maximum flexibility, no restriction is placed on the quality of the
  starting model or its similarity to the target model; the Sculptor step will
  take care of any necessary sequence deletions.  However, in practice it is
  vastly more effective when working with near-identical structures.

- When working with a set of related structures that differ from previously
  solved crystal forms, it will probably be most productive to solve the first
  one interactively, then use this as a starting point for the remaining
  structures.

- Only one type of ligand is supported at present.  Essential cofactors or
  other molecules whose binding mode is already known may included in the
  input model; in these cases, you should add keep_hetatms=True to instruct
  Phaser to leave the occupancies unmodified.  Any additional ligands will
  need to be placed after the final refinement.

- Multiple stereoisomers will need to be screened independently; the program
  does not currently have the ability to evaluate different chiral forms.

- Covalently bound ligands may be placed correctly, but the covalent linkage
  will not be handled, and nonbonded forces may distort binding.  Additionally,
  the ligand parameterization may be based on the unbound molecule.

- Structures such as HIV protease which exhibit symmetric binding of inhibitors
  will not be handled properly - and more generally, alternate conformations
  for the ligand are not modeled.  (The pipeline may be able to place a single
  conformation, however.)

- The pipeline is designed to work at resolutions of 3.0A or better; while
  it is possible to solve complexes at lower resolution, the ligand fitting
  procedure is not expected to work as well.

- There is no high-resolution limit, but structures at atomic resolution will
  inevitably require more manual effort to complete due to the presence of
  alternate conformations and (often) additional small-molecule ligands, which
  are not presently handled by Phenix.

- Building is currently limited to either rebuild-in-place mode or building
  an entirely new model from scratch, and rebuilds the entire model.  This
  means that for structures where local rebuilding or addition of a few
  residues is required, interactive mode will probably be more successful.

- Most of the optimization of program behavior and parameters has been focused
  on structures bound to drug-like molecules; less attention has been given to
  fragments.  These tend to have weaker binding and partial occupancy, and are
  therefore more difficult to distinguish in maps.

Troubleshooting
---------------

The pipeline may fail for a number of reasons, usually because LigandFit could
not successfully place any copies of the ligand.  If this happens, the program
will skip the final refinement step and exit early with an error message.  You
can still run the Coot script to load the output of the previous refinement
or AutoBuild, which may provide clues about the cause of failure.  Several
common problems are listed below.  Note that these may also apply to cases
where the pipeline runs to completion but was unable to place all copies of
the ligand successfully (in which case a warning message will be printed).

- **The protein blocks the ligand site.** This is one of the most common
  problems, especially in structures which undergo extensive conformational
  changes or local rearrangements, such as kinases.  Even a single stray
  sidechain may prevent LigandFit from placing the ligand correctly, both
  due to flattened difference density, and steric clashes.  For structures
  with NCS, this can sometimes be overcome by the NCS application procedure
  described above, but this still requires that at least one copy was placed
  correctly.  Running AutoBuild can sometimes help, but this also has the
  risk of moving the protein into ligand density.  The interactive mode is
  strongly recommended for overcoming this problem.

- **Spurious difference density for other atoms.**  If large regions of
  positive mFo-DFc density corresponding to missing protein residues are
  present, LigandFit may sometimes place the ligand in these sites instead of
  the correct binding site.  Again, interactive mode is the recommended
  solution (and an optimal search model can help too).  Note that unexpected
  ordered buffer components may also lead to false positives; this is
  especially problematic for fragments.

- **Poor or incomplete difference density.**  In some cases, a particularly
  flexible ligand may not fit entirely into difference density; this is not
  uncommon or necessarily problematic, but it can reduce the CC below the
  cutoff required to continue.  More common is poor density quality for the
  entire molecule; this can be caused by an incompletely refined model, low
  resolution, or partial binding.  In some cases, it means that the ligand
  is not bound at all.  While reducing the CC cutoff may allow some
  structures to proceed, we recommend inspecting the density interactively,
  both before and after ligand placement.  Also note that maximum entropy
  treatment of the difference map (``maxent=True``) may improve the fitting
  in borderline cases.

- **Poor ligand geometry.** In some cases eLBOW is unable to automatically
  determine the optimal geometry from the inputs.  Running AM1 optimization
  may help for structures where the initial geometry is partially correct.
  However, in extreme cases the geometry will be too distorted for AM1 to
  work, and additional information on geometry is required.  For this reason,
  we recommend supplying as rich a source of information as possible;
  in particular, if geometry from a crystal structure of the target compound
  is available, this should be included in the inputs.

Other notes about use
---------------------

**Speeding up execution**: the bulk of the runtime is spent refining the model;
the default protocol is very robust but not especially fast, and may be
unnecessarily intensive for easy cases.  You can switch to a faster protocol
by specifying ``quick_refine=True``, which will shorten both refinement steps
from 6 to 3 cycles, and disable weight optimization.

**Hydrogen atoms**: these will be added prior to the final refinement step.
Usually this will improve geometry somewhat (and also R-factors at high
resolution); however, it has the side effect of making refinement significantly
slower.  Specfiy ``after_ligand.hydrogens=False`` to leave them off.

**Rebuilding sidechains**: sidechains truncated by a previous step (Sculptor or
the pruning step), or missing in the input model, may optionally be restored
after ligand placement by specifying ``extend_model=True``.

**Standalone tools**: although most of the pipeline is built around
pre-existing programs in Phenix, several new tools have been developed for
this protocol and are also available as separate command-line programs:

- **mmtbx.select_best_starting_model**: given a data file and a collection
  of PDB files, calculate R-factors and (optionally) run rigid-body
  refinement to pick the best one for further refinement
- **mmtbx.prune_model**: remove protein atoms with poor fit to density.
- **mmtbx.apply_ncs_to_ligand**: place additional copies of the desired
  ligand using NCS operators between protein chains.
- **mmtbx.extend_sidechains**: rebuild missing protein sidechain atoms and
  perform quick real-space refinement.
- **mmtbx.validate_ligand**: check for possible fitting errors in a specific
  ligand.
- **phenix.sort_hetatms**: group heteroatoms (ligands, water, etc.) with the
  closest macromolecule(s) in the PDB file, similar to the procedure used at
  PDB deposition.
- **phenix.development.optimize_model**: this is essentially the final
  refinement step as a standalone program.  It was originally developed as an
  automated tool for re-refining structures in the PDB, and may be useful
  both for preparing starting models and for additional refinement of
  pipeline-built structures after manual fixes.
