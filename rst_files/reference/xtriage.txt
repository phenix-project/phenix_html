Purpose
-------

The xtriage method is a tool for analyzing structure factor data to
identify outliers, presence of twinning and other conditions that the
user should be aware of.

Usage
-----

How xtriage works
-----------------

Basic sanity checks performed by xtriage are

-  Wilson plot sanity
-  Probabilistic Matthews analysis
-  Data strength analysis
-  Ice ring analysis
-  Twinning analysis
-  Reference analysis (determines possible re-indexing. optional)
-  Detwinning and data massaging (optional)

```phenix.reflection_statistics`` <reflection_statistics.html>`__
(comparison of multiple data sets)

Output files from xtriage
-------------------------

-  (1) A log file that contains all the screen output plus some ccp4
   style graphs
-  (2) optional: an mtz file with massaged data

Xtriage keywords in detail
--------------------------

**Scope**: *parameters.asu\_contents*

::

    keys: * n_residues :: Number of residues per monomer/unit
          * n_bases :: Number of nucleotides per monomer/unit
          * n_copies_per_asu :: Number of copies in the ASU.

These keywords control the determination of the absolute scale. If the
number of residues/bases is not specified, a solvent content of 50% is
assumed.

**Scope**: *parameters.misc\_twin\_parameters.missing\_symmetry*

::

    keys: * tanh_location :: tanh decision rule parameter
          * tanh_slope :: tanh decision rule parameter

The ``tanh_location`` and ``tanh_slope`` parameter control what R-value
is considered to be low enough to be considered a 'proper' symmetry
operator. the ``tanh_location parameter`` corresponds to the inflection
point of the approximate step function. Increasing ``tanh_location``
will result in large R-value thresholds. ``tanh_slope`` is set to 50 and
should be okai.

**Scope**: *parameters.misc\_twin\_parameters.twinning\_with\_ncs*

::

    keys: * perform_test :: can be set to True or False
          * n_bins :: Number of bins in determination of D_ncs

The perform\_test is by default set to False. Setting it to True
triggers the determination of the twin fraction while taking into
account NCS parallel to the twin axis.

**Scope**: *parameters.misc\_twin\_parameters.twin\_test\_cuts*

::

    keys: * high_resolution : high resolution for twin tests
          * low_resolution: low resolution for twin tests
          * isigi_cut: I/sig(I) threshold in automatic determination
                       of high resolution limit
          * completeness_cut: completeness threshold in automatic
                              determination of high resolution limit

The automatic determination of the resolution limit for the twinning
test is determined on the basis of the completeness after removing
intensities for which I/sigI < isigi\_cut. The lowest limit obtain in
this way is 3.5A. The value determined by the automatic procedure can be
overruled by specification of the high\_resolution keyword. The low
resolution is set to 10A by default.

**Scope**: *parameters.reporting*

::

    keys: * verbose :: verbosity level.
          * log :: log file name
          * ccp4_style_graphs :: Either True or False. Determines whether or
                                 not ccp4 style logfgra plots are written to the
                                 log file

**Scope**: *xray\_data*

::

    keys: * file_name :: file name with xray data.
          * obs_labels :: labels for observed data is format is mtz or XPLOR/CNS
          * calc_labels :: optional; labels for calculated data
          * unit_cell :: overrides unit cell in reflection file (if present)
          * space_group :: overrides space group in reflection file (if present)
          * high_resolution :: High resolution limit of the data
          * low_resolution :: Low resolution limit of the data

Note that the matching of specified and present labels involves a
sub-string matching algorithm.

**Scope**: *optional*

::

    keys: * hklout :: output mtz file
          * twinning.action :: Whether to detwin the data
          * twinning.twin_law :: using this twin law (h,k,l or x,y,z notation)
          * twinning.fraction :: The detwinning fraction.
          * b_value :: the resulting Wilson B value

The output mtz file contains an anisotropy corrected mtz file, with
suspected outliers removed. The data is put scaled and has the specified
Wilson B value. These options have an associated expert level of 10, and
are not shown by default. Specification of the expert level on the
command line as 'level=100' will show all available options.

Interpreting Xtriage output
---------------------------

Typing:

::

    %phenix.xtriage some_data.sca residues=290 log=some_data.log

results in the following output (parts omitted).

*Matthews analysis*

First, a cell contents analysis is performed. Matthews coefficients,
solvent content and solvent content probabilities are listed, and the
most likely composition is guessed

::

    Matthews coefficient and Solvent content statistics
    ----------------------------------------------------------------
    | Copies | Solvent content | Matthews Coed. | P(solvent cont.) |
    |--------|-----------------|----------------|------------------|
    |      1 |      0.705      |      4.171     |       0.241      |
    |      2 |      0.411      |      2.085     |       0.750      |
    |      3 |      0.116      |      1.390     |       0.009      |
    ----------------------------------------------------------------
    |              Best guess :    2  copies in the asu            |
    ----------------------------------------------------------------

*Data strength*

The next step, the strength of the data is gauged by determining the
completeness of the in resolution bins after application of several
I/sigI cut off values

::

    Completeness and data strength analysis

      The following table lists the completeness in various resolution
      ranges, after applying a I/sigI cut. Miller indices for which
      individual I/sigI values are larger than the value specified in
      the top row of the table, are retained, while other intensities
      are discarded. The resulting completeness profiles are an indication
      of the strength of the data.

    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    | Res. Range   | I/sigI>1  | I/sigI>2  | I/sigI>3  | I/sigI>5  | I/sigI>10 | I/sigI>15 |
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    | 19.87 - 7.98 | 96.4%     | 95.3%     | 94.5%     | 93.6%     | 91.7%     | 89.3%     |
    |  7.98 - 6.40 | 99.2%     | 98.2%     | 97.1%     | 95.5%     | 90.9%     | 84.7%     |
    |  6.40 - 5.61 | 97.8%     | 95.4%     | 93.3%     | 87.1%     | 76.6%     | 66.8%     |
    |  5.61 - 5.11 | 98.2%     | 95.9%     | 94.0%     | 87.9%     | 74.1%     | 58.0%     |
    |  5.11 - 4.75 | 97.9%     | 96.2%     | 94.5%     | 91.1%     | 79.2%     | 62.5%     |
    |  4.75 - 4.47 | 97.4%     | 95.4%     | 93.1%     | 88.9%     | 76.6%     | 56.9%     |
    |  4.47 - 4.25 | 96.5%     | 94.5%     | 92.1%     | 88.0%     | 75.3%     | 56.5%     |
    |  4.25 - 4.07 | 96.6%     | 94.0%     | 91.2%     | 85.4%     | 69.3%     | 44.9%     |
    |  4.07 - 3.91 | 95.6%     | 92.1%     | 87.8%     | 80.1%     | 61.9%     | 34.8%     |
    |  3.91 - 3.78 | 94.3%     | 89.6%     | 83.7%     | 71.1%     | 48.7%     | 20.5%     |
    |  3.78 - 3.66 | 95.7%     | 90.9%     | 85.6%     | 71.5%     | 42.4%     | 14.8%     |
    |  3.66 - 3.56 | 91.6%     | 85.0%     | 78.0%     | 63.3%     | 34.1%     | 9.5%      |
    |  3.56 - 3.46 | 89.8%     | 80.4%     | 70.2%     | 52.8%     | 22.2%     | 3.8%      |
    |  3.46 - 3.38 | 87.4%     | 76.3%     | 64.6%     | 46.7%     | 15.5%     | 1.7%      |
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This analysis is also used in the automatic determination of the high
resolution limit used in the intensity statistics and twin analyses.

*Absolute, likelihood based Wilson scaling*

The (anisotropic) B value of the data is determined using a likelihood
based approach. The resulting B value/tensor is reported:

::

    Maximum likelihood isotropic Wilson scaling
    ML estimate of overall B value of sec17.sca:i_obs,sigma:
    75.85 A**(-2)
    Estimated -log of scale factor of sec17.sca:i_obs,sigma:
    -2.50


    Maximum likelihood anisotropic Wilson scaling
    ML estimate of overall B_cart value of sec17.sca:i_obs,sigma:
    68.92,  0.00,  0.00
           68.92,  0.00
                  91.87
    Equivalent representation as U_cif:
     0.87, -0.00, -0.00
            0.87,  0.00
                   1.16

    ML estimate of  -log of scale factor of sec17.sca:i_obs,sigma:
    -2.50
    Correcting for anisotropy in the data

A large spread in (especially the diagonal) values indicates anisotropy.
The anisotropy is corrected for. This clears up intensity statistics.

*Low resolution completeness analysis*

Mostly data processing software do not provide a clear picture of the
completeness of the data at low resolution. For this reason, *xtriage*
lists the completeness of the data up to 5 Angstrom:

::

    Low resolution completeness analysis

     The following table shows the completeness
     of the data to 5 Angstrom.
    unused:         - 19.8702 [  0/68 ] 0.000
    bin  1: 19.8702 - 10.3027 [425/455] 0.934
    bin  2: 10.3027 -  8.3766 [443/446] 0.993
    bin  3:  8.3766 -  7.3796 [446/447] 0.998
    bin  4:  7.3796 -  6.7336 [447/449] 0.996
    bin  5:  6.7336 -  6.2673 [450/454] 0.991
    bin  6:  6.2673 -  5.9080 [428/429] 0.998
    bin  7:  5.9080 -  5.6192 [459/466] 0.985
    bin  8:  5.6192 -  5.3796 [446/450] 0.991
    bin  9:  5.3796 -  5.1763 [437/440] 0.993
    bin 10:  5.1763 -  5.0006 [460/462] 0.996
    unused:  5.0006 -         [  0/0  ]

This analysis allows one to quickly see if there is any unusually low
completeness at low resolution, for instance due to missing overloads.

*Wilson plot analysis*

A Wilson plot analysis *a la* ARP/wARP is carried out, albeit with a
slightly different standard curve:

::

    Mean intensity analysis
     Analysis of the mean intensity.
     Inspired by: Morris et al. (2004). J. Synch. Rad.11, 56-59.
     The following resolution shells are worrisome:
    ------------------------------------------------
    | d_spacing | z_score | compl. | <Iobs>/<Iexp> |
    ------------------------------------------------
    |    5.773  |   7.95  |   0.99 |     0.658     |
    |    5.423  |   8.62  |   0.99 |     0.654     |
    |    5.130  |   6.31  |   0.99 |     0.744     |
    |    4.879  |   5.36  |   0.99 |     0.775     |
    |    4.662  |   4.52  |   0.99 |     0.803     |
    |    3.676  |   5.45  |   0.99 |     1.248     |
    ------------------------------------------------

     Possible reasons for the presence of the reported
     unexpected low or elevated mean intensity in
     a given resolution bin are :
     - missing overloaded or weak reflections
     - suboptimal data processing
     - satellite (ice) crystals
     - NCS
     - translational pseudo symmetry (detected elsewhere)
     - outliers (detected elsewhere)
     - ice rings (detected elsewhere)
     - other problems
     Note that the presence of abnormalities
     in a certain region of reciprocal space might
     confuse the data validation algorithm throughout
     a large region of reciprocal space, even though
     the data is acceptable in those areas.

A very long list of warnings could indicate a serious problem with your
data. Decisions on whether or not the data is useful, should be cut or
should thrown away altogether, is not straightforward and falls beyond
the scope of *xtriage*.

*Outlier detection and rejection*

Possible outliers are detected on the basis Wilson statistics:

::

    Possible outliers
     Inspired by: Read, Acta Cryst. (1999). D55, 1759-1764

    Acentric reflections:

    -----------------------------------------------------------------
    | d_space |      H     K     L |  |E|  | p(wilson) | p(extreme) |
    -----------------------------------------------------------------
    |   3.716 |      8,    6,   31 |  3.52 |  4.06e-06 |   5.87e-02 |
    -----------------------------------------------------------------

    p(wilson)  : 1-(1-exp[-|E|^2])
    p(extreme) : 1-(1-exp[-|E|^2])^(n_acentrics)
    p(wilson) is the probability that an E-value of the specified
    value would be observed when it would selected at random from
    the given data set.
    p(extreme) is the probability that the largest |E| value is
    larger or equal than the observed largest |E| value.

    Both measures can be used for outlier detection. p(extreme)
    takes into account the size of the data set.

Outliers are removed from the data set in the further analysis. Note
that if pseudo translational symmetry is present, a large number of
'outliers' will be present.

*Ice ring detection*

Ice rings in the data are detected by analyzing the completeness and the
mean intensity:

::

    Ice ring related problems

     The following statistics were obtained from ice-ring
     insensitive resolution ranges
      mean bin z_score      : 3.47
          ( rms deviation   : 2.83 )
      mean bin completeness : 0.99
         ( rms deviation   : 0.00 )

     The following table shows the z-scores
     and completeness in ice-ring sensitive areas.
     Large z-scores and high completeness in these
     resolution ranges might be a reason to re-assess
     your data processing if ice rings were present.

    ------------------------------------------------
    | d_spacing | z_score | compl. | Rel. Ice int. |
    ------------------------------------------------
    |    3.897  |   0.12  |   0.97 |     1.000     |
    |    3.669  |   0.96  |   0.95 |     0.750     |
    |    3.441  |   2.14  |   0.94 |     0.530     |
    ------------------------------------------------

     Abnormalities in mean intensity or completeness at
     resolution ranges with a relative ice ring intensity
     lower then 0.10 will be ignored.

     At 3.67 A there is an lower occupancy
      then expected from the rest of the data set.
      Even though the completeness is lower as expected,
      the mean intensity is still reasonable at this resolution

     At 3.44 A there is an lower occupancy
      then expected from the rest of the data set.
      Even though the completeness is lower as expected,
      the mean intensity is still reasonable at this resolution

     There were  2 ice ring related warnings
     This could indicate the presence of ice rings.

*Anomalous signal*

If the input reflection file contains separate intensities for each
Friedel mate, a quality measure of the anomalous signal is reported:

::

    Analysis of anomalous differences

      Table of measurability as a function of resolution

      The measurability is defined as the fraction of
      Bijvoet related intensity differences for which
      |delta_I|/sigma_delta_I > 3.0
      min[I(+)/sigma_I(+), I(-)/sigma_I(-)] > 3.0
      holds.
      The measurability provides an intuitive feeling
      of the quality of the data, as it is related to the
      number of reliable Bijvoet differences.
      When the data is processed properly and the standard
      deviations have been estimated accurately, values larger
      than 0.05 are encouraging.

    unused:         - 19.8704 [   0/68  ]
    bin  1: 19.8704 -  7.0211 [1551/1585]  0.1924
    bin  2:  7.0211 -  5.6142 [1560/1575]  0.0814
    bin  3:  5.6142 -  4.9168 [1546/1555]  0.0261
    bin  4:  4.9168 -  4.4729 [1563/1582]  0.0081
    bin  5:  4.4729 -  4.1554 [1557/1577]  0.0095
    bin  6:  4.1554 -  3.9124 [1531/1570]  0.0083
    bin  7:  3.9124 -  3.7178 [1541/1585]  0.0069
    bin  8:  3.7178 -  3.5569 [1509/1552]  0.0028
    bin  9:  3.5569 -  3.4207 [1522/1606]  0.0085
    bin 10:  3.4207 -  3.3032 [1492/1574]  0.0044
    unused:  3.3032 -         [   0/0   ]

     The anomalous signal seems to extend to about 5.9 A
     (or to 5.2 A, from a more optimistic point of view)
     The quoted resolution limits can be used as a guideline
     to decide where to cut the resolution for phenix.hyss
     As the anomalous signal is not very strong in this data set
     substructure solution via SAD might prove to be a challenge.
     Especially if only low resolution reflections are used,
     the resulting substructures could contain a significant amount of
     of false positives.

*Determination of twin laws*

Twin laws are found using a modified le-Page algorithm and classified as
merohedral and pseudo merohedral:

::

    Determining possible twin laws.

    The following twin laws have been found:

    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    | Type | Axis   | R metric (%) | delta (le Page) | delta (Lebedev) | Twin law
    |
    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    |   M  | 2-fold | 0.000        | 0.000           | 0.000           | -h,k,-l
    |
    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    M:  Merohedral twin law
    PM: Pseudomerohedral twin law

      1 merohedral twin operators found
      0 pseudo-merohedral twin operators found
    In total,   1 twin operator were found

Non-merohedral (reticular) twinning is not considered. The ``R-metric``
is equal to :

    Sum (M\_i-N\_i)^2 / Sum M\_i^2

M\_i are elements of the original metric tensor and N\_i are elements of
the metric tensor after 'idealizing' the unit cell, in compliance with
the restrictions the twin law poses on the lattice if it would be a
'true' symmetry operator.

The ``delta le-Page`` is the familiar obliquity. The ``delta Lebedev``
is a twin law quality measure developed by A. Lebedev (Lebedev, Vagin &
Murshudov; Acta Cryst. (2006). D62, 83-95.).

Note that for merohedral twin laws, all quality indicators are 0. For
non-merohedral twin laws, this value is larger or equal to zero. If a
twin law is classified as non-merohedral, but has a ``delta le-page``
equal to zero, the twin law is sometimes referred to as a *metric
merohedral twin law*.

*Locating translational pseudo symmetry (TPS)*

TPS is located by inspecting a low resolution Patterson function. Peaks
and their significance levels are reported:

::

    Largest Patterson peak with length larger then 15 Angstrom

    Frac. coord.        :   0.027    0.057    0.345
    Distance to origin  :  17.444
    Height (origin=100) :   3.886
    p_value(height)     :   9.982e-01

      The reported p_value has the following meaning:
        The probability that a peak of the specified height
        or larger is found in a Patterson function of a
        macro molecule that does not have any translational
        pseudo symmetry is equal to  9.982e-01
        p_values smaller then 0.05 might indicate
        weak translation pseudo symmetry, or the self vector of
        a large anomalous scatterer such as Hg, whereas values
        smaller then 1e-3 are a very strong indication for
        the presence of translational pseudo symmetry.

*Moments of the observed intensities*

The moment of the observed intensity/amplitude distribution, are
reported, as well as their expected values:

::

    Wilson ratio and moments

    Acentric reflections

    Centric reflections
       <I^2>/<I>^2    :2.554   (untwinned: 3.000; perfect twin 2.000)
       <F>^2/<F^2>    :0.700   (untwinned: 0.637; perfect twin 0.785)
       <|E^2 - 1|>    :0.896   (untwinned: 0.968; perfect twin 0.736)

Significant departure from the ideal values could indicate the presence
of twinning or pseudo translations. For instance, an <I^2>/<I>^2 value
significantly lower than 2.0, might point to twinning, whereas a value
significantly larger than 2.0, might point towards pseudo translational
symmetry.

*Cumulative intensity distribution*

The cumulative intensity distribution is reported:

    | Maximum deviation centric       :  0.080    |

    | <NZ(obs)-NZ(twinned)>_centric   : -0.039    |
    -----------------------------------------------

The N(Z) test is related to the moments based test discussed above.
Nac\_obs is the observed cumulative distribution of normalized
intensities of the acentric data, and uses the full distribution rather
then just a moment.

The effects of twinning shows itself for Nac\_obs having a more
sigmoidal character. In the case of pseudo centering, Nac\_obs will tend
towards Nc\_theo.

*The L test*

The ``L-test`` is an intensity statistic developed by Padilla and Yeates
(Acta Cryst. (2003), D59: 1124-1130) and is reasonably robust in the
presence of anisotropy and pseudo centering, especially if the miller
indices are partitioned properly. Partitioning is carried out on the
basis of a Patterson analysis. A significant deviation of both <\|L\|>
and <L^2> from the expected values indicate twinning or other problems:

::

     L test for acentric data

     using difference vectors (dh,dk,dl) of the form:
    (2hp,2kp,2lp)
      where hp, kp, and lp are random signed integers such that
      2 <= |dh| + |dk| + |dl| <= 8

      Mean |L|   :0.482  (untwinned: 0.500; perfect twin: 0.375)
      Mean  L^2  :0.314  (untwinned: 0.333; perfect twin: 0.200)

      The distribution of |L| values indicates a twin fraction of
      0.00. Note that this estimate is not as reliable as obtained
      via a Britton plot or H-test if twin laws are available.

Whether or not the <\|L\|> and <L^2> differ significantly from the
expected values, is shown in the final summary (see below).

*Analysis of twin laws*

Twin law specific tests (Britton, H and RvsR) are performed:

    Maximum Likelihood twin fraction determination
        Zwart, Read, Grosse-Kunstleve & Adams, to be published.

       The estimated twin fraction is equal to 0.227

These tests allow one to estimate the twin fraction and (if calculated
data is provided) determine if rotational pseudo symmetry is present.
Another option (albeit more computationally expensive), is to estimate
the correlation between error free, untwinned, twin related normalized
intensities (use the key ``perform=True`` on the command line)

    Estimation of twin fraction, while taking into account the
    effects of possible NCS parallel to the twin axis.
        Zwart, Read, Grosse-Kunstleve & Adams, to be published.

      A parameters D_ncs will be estimated as a function of resolution,
      together with a global twin fraction.
      D_ncs is an estimate of the correlation coefficient between
      untwinned, error-free, twin related, normalized intensities.
      Large values (0.95) could indicate an incorrect point group.
      Value of D_ncs larger than say, 0.5, could indicate the presence
      of NCS. The twin fraction should be smaller or similar to other
      estimates given elsewhere.

      The refinement can take some time.
      For numerical stability issues, D_ncs is limited between 0 and 0.95.
      The twin fraction is allowed to vary between 0 and 0.45.
      Refinement cycle numbers are printed out to keep you entertained.

         2.7666 -- 2.6068 :: 0.754
         2.6068 -- 2.4784 :: 0.735

     The correlation of the calculated F^2 should be similar to
     the estimated values.

      7)    2.6068 -- 2.4784 ::  0.531    0.540

The twin fraction obtained via this method is usually lower than what is
obtained by refinement. The estimated correlation coefficient (D\_ncs^2)
between the twin related F^2 values, is however reasonably accurate.

*Exploring higher metric symmetry*

The fact that a twin law is present, could indicate that the data was
incorrectly processed as well. The example below, shows a P41212 data
set processed in P1:

*Twin analysis summary*

The results of the twin analysis are summarized. Typical outputs look as
follows for cases of wrong symmetry, twin laws but no suspected twinning
and twinned data respectively.

           The multivariate Z score is a quality measure of the given
           spread in intensities. Good to reasonable data is expected
           to have a Z score lower than 3.5.
           Large values can indicate twinning, but small values do not
           necessarily exclude it.

    Patterson analysis
      - Largest peak height   : 6.089
       (corresponding p value : 6.921e-01)


    The largest off-origin peak in the Patterson function is 6.09% of the
    height of the origin peak. No significant pseudo-translation is detected.

    The results of the L-test indicate that the intensity statistics
    behave as expected. No twinning is suspected.
    The symmetry of the lattice and intensity however suggests that the
    input space group is too low. See the relevant sections of the log
    file for more details on your choice of space groups.
    As the symmetry is suspected to be incorrect, it is advisable to reconsider
    data processing.

       (corresponding p value : 9.982e-01)


    The largest off-origin peak in the Patterson function is 3.89% of the
    height of the origin peak. No significant pseudo-translation is detected.

    The results of the L-test indicate that the intensity statistics
    behave as expected. No twinning is suspected.
    Even though no twinning is suspected, it might be worthwhile carrying out
    a refinement using a dedicated twin target anyway, as twinned structures with
    low twin fractions are difficult to distinguish from non-twinned structures.

    Patterson analysis
      - Largest peak height   : 7.300
       (corresponding p value : 4.454e-01)


    The largest off-origin peak in the Patterson function is 7.30% of the
       height of the origin peak. No significant pseudo-translation is detected.

    The results of the L-test indicate that the intensity statistics
    are significantly different then is expected from good to reasonable,
    untwinned data.
    As there are twin laws possible given the crystal symmetry, twinning could
    be the reason for the departure of the intensity statistics from normality.
    It might be worthwhile carrying refinement with a twin specific target
    function.
    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the summary, the significance of the departure of the values of the
L-test from normality are stated. The multivariate Z-score (also known
as the Mahalanobis distance) is used for this purpose.

Examples
--------

Standard run of xtriage
-----------------------

Running xtriage is easy. From the command-line you can type:

::

    phenix.xtriage data.sca

When an MTZ or CNS file is used, labels have to be specified:

::


    phenix.xtriage file=my_brilliant_data.mtz obs_labels='F(+),SIGF(+),F(-),SIGF(-)'

In order to perform a Matthews analysis, it might be useful to specify
the number of residues/nucleotides in the crystallized macro molecule:

::

    phenix.xtriage data.sca n_residues=230 n_bases=25

By default, the screen output plus additional ccp4 style graphs
(viewable with the ccp4 programs loggraph) are echoed to a file named
logfile.log. The command line arguments and all other defaults settings
are summarized in a PHIL parameter data block given at the beginning of
the logfile / screen output:

::


    scaling.input {
      parameters {
        asu_contents {
          n_residues = None
          n_bases = None

          twinning_with_ncs {
            perform_analysis = False
            n_bins = 7
          }
          twin_test_cuts {
            low_resolution = 10
            high_resolution = None
            isigi_cut = 3
            completeness_cut = 0.85
          }
        }
        reporting {
          verbose = 1
          log = "logfile.log"
          ccp4_style_graphs = True
        }
      }
      xray_data {
        file_name = "some_data.sca"
        obs_labels = None
        calc_labels = None

        space_group = "P 1 21 1"
        high_resolution = None
        low_resolution = None
      }
    }

The defaults are good for most applications.
