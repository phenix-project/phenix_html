Purpose
-------

plan\_sad\_experiment is a tool for estimating the anomalous signal that
you might get from your SAD experiment and for predicting whether this
signal would be sufficient to solve the structure. plan\_sad\_experiment
is normally used along with scale\_and\_merge and anomalous\_signal to
plan a SAD experiment, scale the data, and analyze the anomalous signal
before solving the structure.

Usage
-----

How plan\_sad\_experiment works:
--------------------------------

-  You supply plan\_sad\_experiment with a sequence file, the 
   anomalously-scattering atom you plan to use for the experiment,
   and the wavelength for data collection.

-  plan\_sad\_experiment will estimate the necessary I/sigI of your
   dataset to provide enough anomalous signal to solve the structure.

-  plan\_sad\_experiment will try various values of I/sigI for your
   dataset at each of several resolutions. For each I/sigI it will estimate
   the half-dataset anomalous correlation that would result along with the
   likely true correlation between your anomalous differences and those that
   would be calculated from a final model of your structure (cc*\_ano). 
   From this anomalous correlation (cc*\_ano), plan\_sad\_experiment will
   estimate the anomalous signal (related to cc*\_ano by the square root
   of the number of reflections divided by the square root of the number of
   sites).  Then plan\_sad\_experiment will choose a value of I/sigI that gives
   an anomalous signal of about 30 (if achievable with the maximum I/sigI
   you specify).
   

-  The way that plan\_sad\_experiment and anomalous\_signal estimate the 
   probability that you can solve your dataset is to compare the anomalous 
   signal in this dataset with the anomalous signal in other datasets at the
   same resolution. Then the fraction of similar datasets that can be solved
   by HySS is used as the probability that the anomalous substructure for
   your dataset will also be found.

-  Similarly, the mean figure of merit for datasets with an estimated 
   anomalous correlation (cc*_ano) similar to that for your data is used as
   an estimate of the figure of merit that you would obtain if the substructure
   is found for your crystal.

*Output from plan\_sad\_experiment*
-----------------------------------

plan\_sad\_experiment provides a summary of the scattering expected from
your crystal and a summary of the anomalous signal expected if you are able
to measure your data with the suggested overall I/sigI.  You can set the
maximum I/sigI to look for. Here is an example setting max\_i\_over\_sigma=30: ::

    Note: Target anomalous signal not achievable with tested I/sigma (up to 30 )
    for resolutions of  2.50 A and lower. I/sigma shown is value 
    of max\_i\_over\_sigma.
    
    
    This table says that if you collect your data to a resolution of   2.0 A with
    an overall <I>/<sigma> of about  28 then the half-dataset anomalous
    correlation should be about  0.62 (typically within a factor of 2).  This
    should lead to a correlation of your anomalous data to true anomalous
    differences (CC*\_ano) of about  0.66, and a useful anomalous signal around
     29 (again within a factor of about two). With this value of estimated
    anomalous signal the probability of finding the anomalous substructure is
    about  96% (based on estimated anomalous signal and actual outcomes for
    real structures.), and the estimated figure of merit of phasing is 0.17.
    
    The value of sigF/F (actually rms(sigF)/rms(F)) is approximately the inverse 
    of I/sigma. The calculations are based on rms(sigF)/rms(F).
    
    Note that these values assume data measured with little radiation damage or at
    least with anomalous pairs measured close in time. The values also assume that
    the anomalously-scattering atoms are nearly as well-ordered as other atoms.
    If your crystal does not fit these assumptions it may be necessary to collect
    data with even higher I/sigma than indicated here.
    
    Note also that anomalous signal is roughly proportional to the anomalous
    structure factors at a given resolution. That means that if you have 50%
    occupancy of your anomalous atoms, the signal will be 50% of what it otherwise
    would be.  Also it means that if your anomalously scattering atoms only
    contribute to 5 A, you should only consider data to 5 A in this analysis.
    
    What to do next:
    
    1. Collect your data, trying to obtain a value of I/sigma for the whole dataset
       at least as high as your target.
    2. Scale and analyze your unmerged data with phenix.scale\_and\_merge to get
       accurate scaled and merged data as well as two half-dataset data files
       that can be used to estimate the quality of your data.
    3. Analyze your anomalous data (the scaled merged data and the two half-datdaset
       data files) with phenix.anomalous\_signal to estimate the anomalous signal
       in your data. This tool will again guess the fraction of the substructure
       that can be obtained with your data, this time with knowledge of the
       actual anomalous signal.  It will also estimate the figure of merit of
       phasing that you can obtain once you solve the substruture. 
    4. Compare the anomalous signal in your measured data with the
       estimated values in the table above. If they are lower than expected
       you may need to collect more data to obtain the target anomalous signal.
