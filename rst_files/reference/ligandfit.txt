Purpose of the LigandFit Wizard
-------------------------------

The LigandFit Wizard carries out fitting of flexible ligands to electron
density maps.  It can be used with X-ray or cryo-EM data.

Usage
-----

The LigandFit Wizard can be run from the PHENIX GUI, from the
command-line, and from parameters files. All three versions are
identical except in the way that they take commands from the user. See
`Using the PHENIX Wizards <running-wizards.html>`__ for details of how to
run a Wizard. The command-line version will be described here.

How the LigandFit Wizard works
------------------------------

The LigandFit wizard provides a command-line and graphical user
interface allowing the user to identify a datafile containing
crystallographic structure factor information, an optional PDB file with
a partial model of the structure without the ligand, and a PDB file
containing the ligand to be fit (in an allowed but arbitrary
conformation).

The wizard checks the data files for consistency and then calls RESOLVE
to carry out the fitting of the ligand into the electron-density map.
The best map to use is usually a 2Fo-Fc map from phenix.refine.
You can also have LigandFit  calculate a difference map,
with F=FP-FC. It can also be
an Fobs map (calulated from FP with phases PHIC from the input partial
model), or an arbitrary map, calculated with FP PHI and optional FOM. If you
supply an input partial model, then the region occupied by the partial
model is flattened in the map used to fit the ligand, so that the ligand
will normally not get placed in this region.

The ligand fitting is done by RESOLVE in a three-stage process. First,
the largest contiguous region of density in the map not already occupied
by the model is identified. The ligand will be placed in this density.
(If desired, the location of the ligand can instead be defined by the
user as near a certain residue or near specified coordinates. ) Next,
many possible placements of the largest rigid sub-fragments of the
ligand are found within this region of high density. Third, each of
these placements is taken as a starting point for fitting the remainder
of the ligand. All these ligand fits are scored based on the fit to the
density, and the best-fitting placement is written out.

The output of the wizard consists of a fitted ligand in PDB format and a
summary of the quality of the fit. Multiple copies of a ligand can be
fit to a single map in an automated fashion using the LigandFit wizard
as well.

How to run the LigandFit Wizard
-------------------------------

Running the LigandFit Wizard is easy. For example, from the command-line
you can type:

::

    phenix.ligandfit data=datafile.mtz model=partial_model.pdb ligand=ligand.pdb

The LigandFit Wizard will carry out ligand fitting of the ligand in
ligand.pdb based on the structure factor amplitudes in datafile.mtz,
calculating phases based on partial-model.pdb. All rotatable bonds will
be identified and allowed to take stereochemically reasonable
orientations.

What the LigandFit wizard needs to run
--------------------------------------

The ligandfit wizard needs:

-   a datafile (w1.sca or data=w1.sca); this can be any format

-   a PDB file with your model without ligand (model=partial.pdb; optional if your datafile contains map coefficients)

-   a file with information about your ligand (ligand=side.pdb), or a 3-letter code for your ligand (ligand=ATP)

The ligand file can be a PDB file with 1 stereochemically acceptable
conformation of your ligand. It can alternatively be a file containing a
SMILES string, in which case the starting ligand conformation will be
generated with the PHENIX elbow routine. It can also be a 3-letter code
that specifies a ligand in the Chemical Components Dictionary of the
PDB, in which case the ligand is taken from that dictionary with
idealized geometry.

The command\_line ligandfit interpreter will guess which file is your
data file but you have to tell it which file is the model and which is
the ligand.

Specifying which columns of data to use from input data files
-------------------------------------------------------------

If one or more of your data files has column names that the Wizard
cannot identify automatically, you can specify them yourself. You will
need to provide one column "name" for each expected column of data, with
"None" for anything that is missing.

For example, if your data file data.mtz has columns FP SIGFP then you
might specify

::

    data=data.mtz
    input_labels="FP SIGFP"

You can find out all the possible label strings in a data file that you
might use by typing:

::

    phenix.autosol display_labels=data.mtz  # display all labels for data.mtz

You can specify many more parameters as well. See the list of keywords,
defaults and descriptions at the end of this page and also general
information about running Wizards at `Using the PHENIX
Wizards <running-wizards.html>`__ for how to do this. Some of the most
common parameters are:

::

    data=w1.sca       # data file
    partial_model=coords.pdb  # starting model without ligand
    ligand=ligand.pdb # any stereochemically allowed conformation of your ligand
    resolution=3     # dmin of 3 A
    quick=False      # specify if you want to look hard for a good conformation
    ligand_cc_min=0.75   # quit if the CC of ligand to map is 0.75 or better
    number_of_ligands=3  # find 3 copies of the ligand
    n_group_search=3     # try 3 different fragments of the ligand in initial search
    ligand_start=side.pdb # build ligand superimposing on side.pdb

*Output files from LigandFit*
-----------------------------

When you run LigandFit the output files will be in a subdirectory with
your run number:

::

    LigandFit_run_1_/   # subdirectory with results

-  A summary file listing the results of the run and the other files
   produced:

::

    LigandFit_summary.dat  # overall summary

-  A file that lists all parameters and knowledge accumulated by the
   Wizard during the run (some parts are binary and are not printed)

::

    LigandFit_Facts.dat   # all Facts about the run

-  A warnings file listing any warnings about the run

::

    LigandFit_warnings.dat  # any warnings

-  A PDB file with the fitted ligand (in this case the first copy of
   ligand number 1):

::

    ligand_fit_1_1.pdb

-  A log file with the fitting of the ligand:

::

    ligand_1_1.log

-  A log file with the fit of the ligand to the map:

::

    ligand_cc_1_1.log

-  Map coefficients for the map used for fitting:

::

    resolve_map.mtz

Running from a parameters file
------------------------------

You can run phenix.ligandfit from a parameters file. When you
run ligandfit a parameters file is written in the output directory.
Then you can edit this file and run it with:

::

    phenix.ligandfit  my_ligandfit.eff

Examples
--------

Sample command\_line inputs
---------------------------

-  Standard run of ligandfit (generate map from model and data file)

::

    phenix.ligandfit w1.sca model=partial.pdb ligand=ATP \
     lig_map_type=fo-fc_difference_map

-  Build into a map from pre-determined coefficients

::

    phenix.ligandfit data=perfect.mtz \
     lig_map_type=pre_calculated_map_coeffs \
       model=partial.pdb ligand=NAD

-  Quick run of ligandfit

::

    phenix.ligandfit w1.sca model=partial.pdb ligand=ATP quick=True

-  Run ligandfit using pre-calculated map coefficients from
   phenix.refine

If your refine a model with a command such as,

::

    phenix.refine data.mtz partial.pdb

then you will end up with the refined model,

::

    partial_refine_001.pdb

and a map coefficients file:

::

    partial_refine_001_map_coeffs.mtz

You can then run ligandfit using the 2Fo-Fc map calculated from these
map coefficients:

::

    phenix.ligandfit data=partial_refine_001_map_coeffs.mtz \
     model=partial_refine_001.pdb ligand=NAD quick=True

or if you want to specify the coefficients explicitly you can add the
column labels:

::

    phenix.ligandfit data=partial_refine_001_map_coeffs.mtz  \
    model=partial_refine_001.pdb ligand=GOL quick=True \
    input_labels="2FOFCWT PH2FOFCWT"

For a difference map from the same file you can say:

::

    phenix.ligandfit data=partial_refine_001_map_coeffs.mtz  \
     model=partial_refine_001.pdb ligand=AMP quick=True \
     input_labels="FOFCWT PHFOFCWT"

-  Run ligandfit on a series of ligands specified in ligand\_list.dat

::

    phenix.ligandfit w1.sca model=partial.pdb \
      ligand=ligand_list.dat file_or_file_list=file_with_list_of_files

Note that you have to specify

::

    file_or_file_list=file_with_list_of_files

or else the Wizard will try to interpret the contents of
ligand\_list.dat as a SMILES string. Here the
"file\_with\_list\_of\_files" is a flag, not something you substitute
with an actual file name. You use it just as listed above.

-  Place ligand near residue 94 of chain "A" from partial.pdb

::

    phenix.ligandfit w1.sca model=partial.pdb ligand=ADP \
       ligand_near_chain="A" ligand_near_res=92

-  Use start.pdb as a template for some of the atoms in the ligand;
   build the remainder of the ligand, fixing the coordinates of the
   corresponding atoms:

::

    phenix.ligandfit w1.sca model=partial.pdb ligand=GTP \
       ligand_start=start.pdb

NOTE: the file start.pdb must contain an entire rigid group of atoms (so
that ligandfit can identify the position and orientation of at least one
rigid part of the ligand.)

-  Use NCS from the model and the first ligand fitted to guess the
   positions of NCS-related ligands:

::

    phenix.ligandfit w1.sca model=partial.pdb ligand=GTP \
       ligands_from_ncs=True

R-free flags and test set
-------------------------

In Phenix the parameter test\_flag\_value sets the value of the test set
that is to be free. Normally Phenix sets up test sets with values of 0
and 1 with 1 as the free set. The CCP4 convention is values of 0 through
19 with 0 as the free set. Either of these is recognized by default in
Phenix and you do not need to do anything special. If you have any other
convention (for example values of 0 to 19 and test set is 1) then you
can specify this with test\_flag\_value.

Using LigandFit with an mrc map as input
----------------------------------------

You can run ligand fitting using an mrc (or ccp4) map file as input instead
of using map coefficients.  If you supply a map, it will be converted into
map coefficients and then ligand fitting will proceed as usual.  If you
supply a model file, it will be trimmed to remove all atoms outside of the
original boxed map before using it.

If you supply a map that has an origin offset (a boxed map), then the
map will be converted to map coefficients that keep the density in the
same place as the original map.  Then the ligand will be fitted in the
usual way.

If your map has an origin offset that is specified by an external origin,
the external origin is normally converted into an origin offset as in the
above case. Note that not all display programs can properly display maps with
external origins.

What to do next after LigandFit
-------------------------------

Normally the next step after LigandFit is refinement (with phenix.refine
for X-ray data or phenix.real_space_refine for cryo-EM data) and validation,
iterating with manual rebuilding.

If LigandFit fails to find a ligand, have a close look at your map to see
whether there is clear density for a ligand. If not, then you should not try
to fit a ligand. If there is clear density but LigandFit does not find it,
try increasing the number of conformers of the ligand that are tried, try 
varying the resolution, and check to make sure that you are looking for the
right ligand.


Possible Problems
-----------------

In some cases ligand fitting results in an incomplete ligand (some atoms
are missing).  Here is a procedure you can try to complete the ligand:


- Add the following commands to in the GUI in the field 
  called "Resolve commands" (use the search function to 
  find the input field).  Include the quotes just as in the example below:

- "dist_min_offset 1" "density_off_final 1000" "acceptable_offset 2"

- You may wish to set:  nbatch=20  conformers=0 (these may not affect the
  results in many cases) 

- Run ligandfit and make sure the ligand contains all the input atoms.

- If not, take the complete ligand and superimpose it on the partial ligand
  that was fitted.

Specific limitations and problems
---------------------------------

-  The ligand to be searched for must have at least 3 atoms.

-  The partial-model file must not have any atoms (other than waters,
   which are automatically removed) in the position where the ligand is
   to be built. If this file contains atoms other than waters in the
   position where the ligand is to be built, then you may wish to remove
   them before building the ligand.

-  If your ligand file has more than one ligand in it (or copies of the
   same ligand with different residue numbers), they will be treated as
   a single ligand. Typically this will result in part of the ligand (i.e.,
   just one of the component ligands ) being fitted.  Normally supply 
   instead a single ligand
   in your ligand file (or multiple copies of your ligand with different
   conformations and all the same residue number if you are trying to specify
   allowed conformations.)

-  If a ring in the ligand can have more than one conformation (e.g.,
   chair or boat conformation) then you need to do separate runs for
   each conformation of the ring (rings are taken as fixed units in
   LigandFit).

-  If you want to treat your entire ligand as a single entity (no groups),
   then use the command: resolve_command_list="'bond_tol 100'"  (both sets
   of quotes needed in command line, in GUI put in the inner set of quotes).

-  LigandFit ignores insertion codes, so if you specify a residue with
   ligand\_near\_res, only the residue number is used.

-  The size of the asymmetric unit in the SOLVE/RESOLVE portion of the
   LigandFit wizard is limited by the memory in your computer and the
   binaries used. The Wizard is supplied with regular-size ("", size=6),
   giant ("\_giant", size=12), huge ("\_huge", size=18) and extra\_huge
   ("\_extra\_huge", size=36). Larger-size versions can be obtained on
   request.

-  The LigandFit Wizard can take most settings of most space groups,
   however it can only use the hexagonal setting of rhombohedral space
   groups (eg., #146 R3:H or #155 R32:H), and it cannot use space groups
   114-119 (not found in macromolecular crystallography) even in the
   standard setting due to difficulties with the use of asuset in the
   version of ccp4 libraries used in PHENIX for these settings and space
   groups.
