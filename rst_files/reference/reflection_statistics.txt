**phenix.reflection_statistics**

Comparisions between multiple datasets are available via the
``phenix.reflection_statistics`` command::

  Usage: phenix.reflection_statistics [options] reflection_file [...]

  Options:
    -h, --help            show this help message and exit
    --unit-cell=10,10,20,90,90,120|FILENAME
                          External unit cell parameters
    --space-group=P212121|FILENAME
                          External space group symbol
    --symmetry=FILENAME   External file with symmetry information
    --weak-symmetry       symmetry on command line is weaker than symmetry found
                          in files
    --quick               Do not compute statistics between pairs of data arrays
    --resolution=FLOAT    High resolution limit (minimum d-spacing, d_min)
    --low-resolution=FLOAT
                          Low resolution limit (maximum d-spacing, d_max)
    --bins=INT            Number of bins
    --bins-twinning-test=INT
                          Number of bins for twinning test
    --bins-second-moments=INT
                          Number of bins for second moments of intensities
    --lattice-symmetry-max-delta=LATTICE_SYMMETRY_MAX_DELTA
                          angular tolerance in degrees used in the determination
                          of the lattice symmetry

  Example: phenix.reflection_statistics data1.mtz data2.sca

This utility reads one or more reflection files (many common formats
incl. MTZ, Scalepack, CNS, SHELX). For each of the datasets found
in the reflection files the output shows a block like the following::

  Miller array info: gere_MAD.mtz:FSEinfl,SIGFSEinfl,DSEinfl,SIGDSEinfl
  Observation type: xray.reconstructed_amplitude
  Type of data: double, size=20994
  Type of sigmas: double, size=20994
  Number of Miller indices: 20994
  Anomalous flag: 1
  Unit cell: (108.742, 61.679, 71.652, 90, 97.151, 90)
  Space group: C 1 2 1 (No. 5)
  Systematic absences: 0
  Centric reflections: 0
  Resolution range: 24.7492 2.74876
  Completeness in resolution range: 0.873513
  Completeness with d_max=infinity: 0.872315
  Bijvoet pairs: 10497
  Lone Bijvoet mates: 0
  Anomalous signal: 0.1065

This is followed by a listing of the completeness and the anomalous
signal in resolution bins. The number of bins and the resolution range
may be adjusted with the options shown above.

*Unless* the ``--quick`` option is specified the output will also show
the correlations between the datasets and, if applicable, between the
anomalous differences, both as overall values and in bins. The
correlation between anomalous differences is often a very powerful
indicator for the resolution up to which the anomalous signal is useful
for substructure determination.
