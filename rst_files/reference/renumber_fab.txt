phenix.renumber_fab
===================

Description
-----------

The *renumber_fab* tool is designed to streamline the renumbering process
for FAB chains. It performs a search among a set of supplied sequences to
find the most similar sequence. Once identified, this sequence is sent
to the server to retrieve the appropriate numbering. The tool supports
various renumbering schemes, such as Kabat, Chothia, and Martin.

Requirements: A model and its corresponding sequence.

Ensure that the sequence encompasses the entire FAB structure and adequately
covers the entire chains in the model.

Additionally, the tool will update HELIX/SHEET records describing secondary
structure. However, it will neither renumber nor output SSBOND, LINK, and
certain other records.

You can customize the similarity threshold by adjusting the
'identity' parameter in case the sequences are not closely matched.
The tool generates detailed logs,
giving insights into similarity and matched chains.

!!! WARNING !!! This program sends supplied sequence to AbNum server at
