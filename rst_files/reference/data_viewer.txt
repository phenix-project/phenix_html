Visualizing reflection data in Phenix
=====================================

Overview
--------

The program ``phenix.data_viewer`` is used to explore data in reciprocal
space, as a diagnostic and learning tool.  Although reciprocal space is
largely an imaginary construct, it is a convenient way to describe the
geometry of diffraction and data collection.  Two different rendering methods
are provided: a 3D view of all of reciprocal space at once, and a 2D view
of planes of reflections, or "pseudo-precession photographs".  These are
largely complementary, although certain visualizations may be easier in one
or the other view.

``phenix.data_viewer`` can be launched from the GUI, under "Reflection tools",
where the 2D and 3D versions are listed separately, or directly from the
command line, which initially starts the 3D version.  OpenGL support (and
ideally a reasonably fast graphics card) is required for the 3D graphics; for
this reason, we do not recommend running the 3D viewer over an X11 connection.
Once the program opens it will ask you to select a reflections file, which
depending on contents may prompt you to choose an array of data.  Currently
any array which includes amplitudes or intensities (including map coefficients)
can be viewed, as well as phase angles and R-free flags.  However, the examples
shown here all use amplitudes or intensities.

3D viewer
---------

For most reflections files, the data will fill some portion of a sphere, whose
radius is one divided by the maximum resolution.  Depending on space group
symmetry and whether the data are symmetry-unique, usually only a wedge of
data will be shown.  If the data are anomalous this wedge will be mirrored
across the origin.  For instance, the intensity data for the p9-sad tutorial
(included with Phenix) will appear like this:

  .. image:: ../images/data_viewer_p9_3d.png

In this case the space group is I4 with anomalous data, so the symmetry-unique
reflections fill two 90-degree wedges of reciprocal space.  Identifying
features in the data is left as an exercise to the user; however, in this
case (and many others) the characteristic distribution of intensities seen in
the Wilson plot in `Xtriage <xtriage_gui.html>`_ is very obvious: relatively
high intensities at low resolution (at the center of the sphere), decreasing
rapidly above approximately 10 Angstrom, with a large increase in mean
intensity around 4-5 Angstrom due to characteristic inter-atomic distances in
organic (especially macromolecular) structures.  Clicking on any individual
reflection will show the h,k,l index, resolution, and value in the box on
the lower-left corner.

The view can be manipulated with the controls on the left-hand side of the
window; this includes the option to change the symmetry or generate
anomalous data if not are present in the input file.  A particularly useful
option is to show reflections that are missing.  These will appear as white
spheres:

  .. image:: ../images/data_viewer_p9_3d_missing.png

Most datasets will have at least a handful of these at high resolution, and
often the innermost low-resolution reflections will also be absent due to
beamstop overlap.  In this case a large contiguous region of missing data is
visible for one of the quadrants; this is probably caused by imperfect
orientation of the crystal during data collection.  For this dataset the
number of missing reflections is relatively small and because of the overall
excellent quality, no impact on phasing, refinement, or map quality is
observed.  However, poor completeness can often lead to problems at various
stages of refinement, especially if large regions of reciprocal space are
systematically missing.

2D viewer
---------

The 2D view handles symmetry-unique data differently than the 3D version: it
will always expand these data to P1 and generate anomalous pairs, covering
all of reciprocal space.  (For non-unique data, only those reflections present
in the input file will be displayed.)  This will result in a view something
like this (here using the rnase-s tutorial):

  .. image:: ../images/data_viewer_rnase_2d.png

In this example both missing reflections (small white open circles) and
systematic absences (large purple open circles) are also displayed.  The
distribution of values is different than observed for the p9-sad example,
partly because amplitudes are displayed instead of intensities, and partly
because the data were probably not collected or processed to the maximum
resolution possible for this crystal.
