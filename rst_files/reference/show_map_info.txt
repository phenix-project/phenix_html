Purpose
-------

The routine show_map_info will show a summary of the data in a 
map file (ccp4/mrc/map).

Definitions of map specifications
---------------------------------

A map file contains a box of data on a grid.  This box of data may be
the original box of data or it might be a smaller box cut out of the 
original box of data.

The map file also contains meta-data including a 'unit cell' and gridding 
for a unit cell.  The unit cell usually corresponds to the full original box of
data. The 'unit cell grid' is the grid corresponding to the unit cell. The
unit cell has dimensions defined by 'unit cell parameters'.

The map that is present is represented on part or all of the 
unit cell grid.  It starts at the grid point called the 
'origin' and goes to one grid point in each
direction before the grid point called 'last'.  The map that is present
has 'all' grid points in each direction.  The map that is present has a
'map unit cell' and 'map grid' that correspond to the dimensions 'all'.

Example: a full map with a unit cell grid of (10, 10, 10) goes from
(0, 0, 0) to (9, 9, 9) and has dimensions of (10, 10, 10).

Example: a partial map with a unit cell grid of (10,10,10) and an origin
of (0, 0, 2) and a map grid or 'all' of (6, 6, 6), would go
from (0, 0, 2) to (5, 5, 7).


A map file has a 'pixel size' in each direction (usually they are all the same).
The pixel size is the dimension along x, y, or z divided by the number of
grid points along that direction.

A map file has a 'map unit cell' which corresponds to the dimensions of the
box of data that is present in the map.  This will be the same as the
unit cell of the full map if the entire map is present.

External origin (ORIGIN record in map file)
-------------------------------------------

A map file can have an 'external_origin' defined.  The external origin is 
an offset that is intended to be applied to a model file to superimpose the
model on the map.  If a map has an external origin defined, show_map_info
will print out this value.

Phenix does not generally support the external_origin
values.  You can however shift a model file (PDB/mmCIF) based on 
a value of the external_origin with the tool phenix.shift_model_to_match_map

::

  phenix.shift_model_to_match_map map_file.mrc model_file.pdb

Wrapping of a map
-----------------

Maps can be periodic (wrapping = True) or non-periodic (wrapping = False).
If you cut out a box from a periodic map, the new map is non-periodic.

If a map is periodic, then values at coordinates (x,y,z) outside the map 
are defined and can be obtained simply by translating (x,y,z) by integral
numbers of the unit cell translations a,b,c (N * a, M * b, O * c) where
N,M and O are integers.  If a map is not periodic, values outside the supplied
map are not defined.

In most Phenix methods, it is assumed that cryo-EM maps are non-periodic and
X-ray (crystal) maps are periodic. You can specify in many cases whether your
map is periodic or not, however, using the 'wrapping' keyword.

When you run show_map_info it will tell you whether the map supports wrapping.


Standard run of show_map_info:
----------------------------------

You can use show_map_info to summarize a map file like this:

::

   phenix.show_map_info my_map_file.mrc


You can get the value of the map at a particular grid point with:

::

   phenix.show_map_info my_map_file.mrc grid_point_to_show=6,2,5
