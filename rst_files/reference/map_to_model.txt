How map\_to\_model works:
-------------------------

If you have a CCP4-style (mrc, etc) map or just mtz map coefficients 
and a sequence file, you can use map\_to\_model to build a model into
your map. The tool map\_to\_model will identify what kind of chains to
build based on your sequence file.  It will find where your molecule is
in the map and cut out and work with just that part of the density.

To run map\_to\_model successfully, you'll need a map with resolution of
about 4.5 A or better.  The higher the resolution, the more complete the
model that you will typically get.

If your map has been averaged based on reconstruction symmetry and 
you supply a file with that symmetry information (.ncs_spec, biomtr.dat, etc),
map\_to\_model will find the asymmetric unit of the map, build that, then
expand to the entire map.  You can also just supply the type of symmetry
(e.g., D7) or ask to check all plausible symmetry.

The map\_to\_model tool will cut the density 
in your map into small pieces of connected density and 
try to build model into each one. It will merge all the 
pieces into a compact model, refine it, and superimpose 
final model on the original map. The type of chain or chains to be
built are chosen based on your sequence file.  If multiple chain types
are considered, the entire map is interpreted with each chain type, then
the best-fitting non-overlapping chains are chosen.

*Output files from map\_to\_model*
----------------------------------

**map\_to\_model.pdb**: A PDB file with the resulting model, superimposed on
   the original map (or on the magnified map if magnification is applied).



*Applying magnification to the map*
-----------------------------------

Cryo-EM maps often have a scale that is not precisely defined by the 
experiment. map\_to\_model allows application of a scale factor
(magnification) to the grid of the map.  Normally this scale factor
will be close to 1. If the magnification is specified and is not
equal to 1, it will be applied to the input map and a magnification map
will be written out to the output directory and will be used as if it were
the original input file from then on.  Additionally any input symmetry
information will be adjusted by the same magnification factor (translations and
centers are scaled by the magnification factor, rotations are unchanged).
Any input models are not modified.


*Shifting the map to the origin*
--------------------------------

Most crystallographic maps have the origin at the corner of the map (
grid point [0,0,0]), while most cryo-EM maps have the orgin in the 
middle of the map.  To make a consistent map, any maps with an origin not 
at the corner are shifted to put the origin at grid point [0,0,0]. This map
is the shifted map that is used for further steps in model-building.
At the conclusion of model-building, the model is shifted back to 
superimpose on the original map.

*Finding the region containing the molecule*
--------------------------------------------

By default (density\_select=True), the region of the map containing density
is cut out of the entire map. This is particularly useful if the original map
is very large and the molecule only takes up a small part of the map.  This
portion of the map is then shifted to place the origin at grid point [0,0,0].
(At the conclusion of model-building, the final model is shifted back to 
superimpose on the original map.)  The region containing density is chosen
as a box containing all the points above a threshold, typically 5% of the
maximum in the map.


*Map sharpening/blurring*
-------------------------

By default (auto\_sharpen=True) the resolution dependence of the map will
be adjusted to maximize the clarity of the map.  You can choose to use
map kurtosis or the adjusted surface area of the map (default) for this 
purpose.  

Kurtosis is a standard statistical measure that reflects the peakiness of 
the map.  

The adjusted surface area is a combination of the surface area of
contours in the map at a particular threshold
and of the number of distinct regions enclosed by the top 30% (default) of
those contours.  The threshold is chosen by default to be one where the 
volume enclosed by the contours is 20% of the non-solvent volume in the map. 
The weighting between the surface area (to be maximized) and number of regions
enclosed (to be minimized) is chosen empirically (default region_weight=20).


Several resolution-dependent functions are tested, and the one
that gives the best adjusted surface area (or kurtosis) is chosen.  
In each case the map is transformed to obtain Fourier coefficients. The
amplitudes of these coefficients are then adjusted, keeping the phases
constant. The available functions for modifying the amplitudes are:

::

  No sharpening (map is left as is)

  Sharpening b-factor applied over entire resolution range (b_sharpen
  applied to achieve an effective isotropic overall b-value of b_iso).

  Sharpening b-factor applied up to resolution specified with the
  resolution=xxx keyword, then blurring applied beyond this resolution (with
  transition specified by the keyword k_sharpen, b_iso_to_d_cut).  If 
  sharpening value is less than zero (map is to be blurred),
  the blurring is applied over the entire resolution range.

  Resolution-dependent sharpening factor with three parameters.
  First the resolution-dependence of the map is removed by normalizing the
  amplitudes.  Then a scale factor S is to the data, where  
  log10(S) is determined by coefficients b[0],b[1],b[2] and a resolution 
  d_cut (typically d_cut is the nominal resolution of the map).
  The value of log10(S) varies smoothly from 0 at resolution=infinity, to b[0]
  at d_cut/2, to b[1] at d_cut, and to b[1]+b[2] at the highest resolution
  in the map.  The value of b[1] is limited to being no larger than b[0] and the
  value of b[1]+b[2] is limited to be no larger than b[1]. 

  Sharpening using a half-dataset correlation.  
  The resolution-dependent correlation of density in two half-maps
  is used to identify the optimal resolution-dependent weighting of
  the map.  This approach requires a target resolution which is used
  to set the overall fall-off with resolution for an ideal map.  That
  fall-off for an ideal map is then multiplied by an estimated
  resolution-dependent correlation of density in the map with the true
  map (the estimation comes from the half-map correlations).
  
  
  Model-based sharpening.
  You can identify the sharpening parameters using your map and a
  model.  This approach requires a guess of the RMSD between the model and
  the true model.  The resolution-dependent correlation of model and map
  density is used as in the half-map approach above to identify the
  weighting of Fourier coefficients.


*Local sharpening*
------------------

Any of the sharpening methods can be applied locally instead of globally
over the entire map. For local sharpening, the map is cut into overlapping
boxes and sharpening parameter are determined for that box and applied.
For parts of boxes that overlap, the distances from a grid point to the 
centers of the corresponding boxes are used to weight the values for those
boxes.


*Finding the asymmetric unit of the map*
----------------------------------------

If you supply symmetry matrices describing the symmetry used to average 
the map (if any),
then map\_to\_model will try to define a region of the map that represents
the asymmetric unit of the map.  Application of the symmetry operators to the 
asymmetric unit will generate the entire map, and application to a model built
into the asymmetric unit will generate the entire model.  

You can also supply the type of symmetry (e.g., C3, D7, etc) 
and map\_to\_model will try to find that symmetry in the map. You can even
search for all plausible symmetry (ANY).  For helical symmetry either a
symmetry file or the rotation and translation information is required, however.

Normally
identification of the asymmetric unit and segmentation of the map (below)
are done as a single step, yielding an asymmetric unit and a set of
contiguous regions of density within that asymmetric unit. The asymmetric unit
will be written out as a map to the segmentation\_dir directory,
superimposed on the shifted map (so that they can be viewed together in Coot).

*Segmentation of the map*
-------------------------

By default (segment=True) the map or asymmetric unit of the map will
be segmented (cut into small pieces) into regions of connected density. This
is done by choosing a threshold of density and identifying contiguous regions
where all grid points are above this threshold. The threshold is chosen to
yield regions that have a size corresponding to about 50 residues.  The
regions of density are written out to the segmentation\_dir directory
and are superimposed on the shifted map (if you load the shifted map in 
Coot and a region map in Coot, they should superimpose.) 

*Model-building*
----------------

Models are built in several ways by map\_to\_model and then the best-fitting, 
non-overlapping models are chosen.  The main methods used for model-building 
are: 

::

  Standard RESOLVE model-building for PROTEIN/RNA/DNA for the entire 
  asymmetric unit  (or the entire molecule if no symmetry was used ).

  Helices (RNA) or helices/strands (PROTEIN) for entire asymmetric unit

  tracing chain (RNA/PROTEIN/DNA) for each segmented region, with various
  values of map sharpening applied

  RESOLVE model-building for each segmented region, with various values of
  map sharpening applied

Intermediate models are refined with phenix.real\_space\_refine and are
written out relative to the shifted map with origin at [0,0,0]. 
You can view these intermediate models, the shifted map, and the 
shifted map containing just the asymmetric unit , and any 
region maps in Coot and they should all superimpose.

Once all intermediate models are built, all models of each chain type are
combined, taking the best-fitting model for each part of the map. Then all 
chain types are combined, once again taking the best-fitting model for each
part of the map.  The models are refined again.

Then (if present) symmetry is applied to the model and the full model is refined.
Finally the best model, with symmetry applied if present, is shifted to match 
the original map and is written out.


*Iterative map improvement with model-building and sharpening*
--------------------------------------------------------------

You can carry out multiple cycles of model-building and map sharpening,
using the model from each cycle in the sharpening process. The map is 
sharpened to make it as similar as possible to density calculated from
the current model and the new map is used for the next cycle of model
building.


Examples
--------

Standard run of map\_to\_model:
-------------------------------

Running map\_to\_model is easy. From the command-line you can type:

::

    phenix.map_to_model my_map.map seq.fa ncs_file=find_ncs.ncs_spec
       resolution=3

where my_map.map is a CCP4, mrc or other related map format, seq.fa is a
sequence file, and find_ncs.ncs_spec is an optional file specifying any
symmetry operators used in averaging the map. This can be in the form of
BIOMTR records from a PDB file as well.

Standard run of map\_to\_model, specifying symmetry type:
---------------------------------------------------------

Running map\_to\_model with symmetry is also easy. From the command-line 
you can type:

::

    phenix.map_to_model my_map.map seq.fa symmetry=D7 resolution=3

Here map\_to\_model will look for D7 (7-fold symmetry along the c-axis and 
2-fold symmetry along a or b) in the map and apply it if it is found. It will
also write out the matrices corresponding to this symmetry.

Using carry\_on to continue with a partially-finished run
---------------------------------------------------------

If you have a completed or partially-completed run of map\_to\_model and 
you want to run again but you do not want to re-run all the steps, you can
just carry on from where you left off by using the keyword carry\_on=True.

Using carry\_on to break up your run into small pieces 
------------------------------------------------------

You can use carry\_on=True to progressively build up your model 
from pieces or to run many jobs in parallel.

First you run map_to_model with segment_and_split_only=True
to split up your
map and write a file (the info_pickle_file) that has all the 
necessary information to put everything together.

Then you can create script files to run each small step in the
analysis. You can do that with the keyword split_up_job=True. This
will put your scripts in a commands/ subdirectory and you can
run them with your queueing system.  When they are done,
you can use carry_on=True to put everything together.

You can also specify a source or other command to be placed in all
your scripts with the keyword source_command="xxx".


The scripts created by the split_up_job command use a set of keywords 
like this (here only RNA will
be built, building will be done in just region number 26,
secondary structure searches are disabled and overall model-building
is disabled:

::

  do_only_one_thing=True 
  chain_type=RNA
  build_in_regions=True
  input_map_id_start=26
  input_map_id_end=26

  include_helices_strands_only=False
  include_phase_and_build=False

Another run might look like this, where overall model-building
is done starting with model number 4:

::

  do_only_one_thing=True 
  chain_type=PROTEIN
  build_in_regions=False
  include_helices_strands_only=False
  include_phase_and_build=True
  model_start=4

You can run all the combinations that you would like in parallel.


Special treatment of structures with very high symmetry
-------------------------------------------------------

If your structure has very high symmetry (by default, 20 or more symmetry
operators), then segment\_and\_split\_map will try to cut out a piece
of your map and work with that instead of working with the whole map.
You can control this with the keyword select_au_box=True (or None, which
will give the default behavior).  If you use select_au_box then a box
that contains about n_au_box asymmetric units of the map (default of 5)
will be cut out of your map.  That map will be worked with along with the
symmetry operators that apply to it for the remainder of the analysis.
At the end of the analysis, just the region cut out will be built and
placed in the original reference frame.  This process can greatly speed
up building and save on memory.


Building just the asymmetric unit of your model to save memory
--------------------------------------------------------------

Another way to save on memory is to 
run just the segment_and_split step of map_to_model on a computer with a 
lot of memory, then use the small map created by segment_and_split
for subsequent stages, and then finally take the resulting model for this
small map, put it into map_to_model on the computer with a lot of
memory and use it to create a final model.  Here are the steps for doing this:

::

  In a clean directory,
  run phenix.map_to_model with the keyword
  stop_after_segment_and_split_map=True on your map, including symmetry 
  information. Run this on a computer with a huge amount of memory.
  Your segmentation information will be in segmented_maps/

  Take the file segmented_maps/box_map_au.ccp4, which contains just the
  asymmetric unit of density from your original map, and in a new 
  directory (perhaps box_map_directory/) 
  run phenix.map_to_model with box_map_au.ccp4 and the unique
  part of your sequence file.  This can be run (with luck) on a computer
  with a more moderate amount of memory.  The final model will be
  box_map_directory/map_to_model/map_to_model.pdb; 
  it should match the box_map_au.ccp4 map.

  Go back to the original directory where you split up your original map.
  Run phenix.map_to_model with carry_on=True and specifying three keywords:

  starting_model=box_map_directory/map_to_model/map_to_model.pdb 
  starting_model_is_from_box_map_au=True 
  build_new_model=False 

  Now map_to_model will start with your model from the small map, shift it
  to match the original map, apply any symmetry you used originally,
  refine the model, and write out a model map_to_model/map_to_model.pdb


Possible Problems
-----------------

If you have a very large structure it is possible that your computer may not
have enough memory to run map\_to\_model and that one or more sub-processes 
might crash.  

One solution for this is that map\_to\_model will automatically build just
a small part of structures with high symmetry.

A second solution for this is to build just the asymmetric
unit of your model (if your map has symmetry).   You can also set the
keyword coarse_grid=True to use a coarse grid in RESOLVE and save memory.  
You can also cut back the resolution which will save memory.  
Otherwise, you can try on a computer with even more memory.  

If your queueing system crashes during a run or one or more sub-processes
crashes, then you might end up with models built for some stages of
building and others not. You can continue on with the keyword
carry_on=True in this case.
(see above in the section on combining partial runs).
