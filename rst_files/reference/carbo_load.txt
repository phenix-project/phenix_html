CarboLoad
=========

Overview
--------

CarboLoad will load carbohydrates into your model. It can be used in several
modes. The modes are designed as a progression to help guide the user at the
command-line. Notwithstanding, some modes are useful in their own right.

Mode 0
++++++

The help mode gives the command::

  phenix.carbo_load

or::

  phenix.carbo_load --help

give::

  CarboLoad - A program for loading carbohydrates into a protein model

  Usage: 
    phenix.carbo_load protein_pdb_file_name=pdb3a37.ent \ 
                      carbohydrate_file_name=man.txt \
                      map_coeffs_file_name=pdb3a36_refine_001_map_coeffs.mtz \
                      residue_selection="resname LG1"

For more details on the parameters see below.

Mode 1
++++++

This mode is designed to find all possible N-linking sites.::

  phenix.carbo_load model.pdb

or::

  phenix.carbo_load protein_pdb_file_name=model.pdb

will output a list of all ASN residues that are in the motif for N-linking to
carbohydrates. It will also print out a possible selection such as::

  residue_selection="chainid A resname ASN resid 37"

.. _input-files:

Mode 2
++++++

Adding a carbohydrate polymer to the model requires a residue selection for
the addition and the carbohydrate information. The addtion of e.g.::

  residue_selection="chainid A resname ASN resid 37" carbohydrate_file_name=NAG-NAG

will add a chain of two NAG units to the selected ASN. THe carbohydrate
parameter can be a SCaLES string (see below) or a file containing a 
SCaLES string or GlycoCT format (see below).

Mode 3
++++++

If you include a data file or, more efficiently and flexibly, a map file 
CarboLoad with perform a Real Space Refinement when each saccharide unit is
placed in the model.

Input files
-----------

CarboLoad requires a number of inputs and also has some options, all of which
are provided using the ``phil`` formalism. The list of
required inputs:

  - **protein_pdb_file_name**: this is a file containing the protein
    model of current interest into which the carbohydrates will be loaded. It is
    best to have a CRYST1 record in place.

  - **map_coeffs_file_name**: this is a maps coefficients file output from
    a ``phenix.refine`` run.

  - **data_file_name**: a data file. A maps coefficients file is saved for
    possible use in subsequent runs as it saves time.

The input for the carbohydrates can be either a string on the command-line or
a file name containing the allowable formats.

  - **carbohydrate_file_name**: this is a file containing chemical information
    about the carbohydrates.

    1. GlycoCT (Herget et al.) : This can be generated using the `Carbohydrate Builder`_
       in REEL.

    2. `Simplified Carbohydrate Line-Entry System (SCaLES)`_ : The
       majority of carbohydrates linked to proteins a N-linked shorted
       polymers of high mannose. The add the first three units the
       parameters can be set to "NAG-NAG-MAN". More details are
       available here_.

.. _`Simplified Carbohydrate Line-Entry System (SCaLES)`: scales.html
.. _here: scales.html

Optional inputs include:

  - **output.file_name**: Name of the output files.

Optional control parameters include:

  - **allow_multiple_chain_selection**: makes the residue selection work
    on every chain in the model. This is useful in situation where the 
    model contains multiple identical (almost) chains.

  - **nprocs**: runs each carbohydrate polymer addition in a seperate
    process. Useful for adding more than one polysaccharide.

  - **nqueues**: runs jobs on a local queueing system.

Output files
------------

By default, CarboLoad will generate a PDB file with the loaded
carbohydrates and the linking files. These are no longer required by
``phenix.refine`` but are instructive.
