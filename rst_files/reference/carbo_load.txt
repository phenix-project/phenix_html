CarboLoad

Overview
--------

CarboLoad will load carbohydrates into your model. It can be used in several
modes. The first mode is designed to find all possible N-linking sites.

phenix.carbo_load model.pdb

will output a list of all ASN residues that are in the motif for N-linking to
carbohydrates.

Input files
-----------

CarboLoad requires a number of inputs and also has some options, all of which
are provided using the ``phil`` formalism. The list of
required inputs:

  - **protein_pdb_file_name**: this is a file containing the protein
    model of current interest into which the carbohydrates will be loaded. It is
    best to have a CRYST1 record in place.

  - **map_coeffs_file_name**: this is a maps coefficients file output from
    a ``phenix.refine`` run.

  - **data_file_name**: a data file. A maps coefficients file is saved for
    possible use in subsequent runs as it saves time.

The input for the carbohydrates can be either a string on the command-line or
a file name containing the allowable formats.

  - **carbohydrate_file_name**: this is a file containing chemical information
    about the carbohydrates.

    1. GlycoCT : This can be generated using the `Carbohydrate Builder`_
       in REEL.

    2. `Simplified Carbohydrate Line-Entry System (SCaLES)`_ : The
       majority of carbohydrates linked to proteins a N-linked shorted
       polymers of high mannose. The add the first three units the
       parameters can be set to "NAG-NAG-MAN". More details are
       available here_.

Optional inputs include:

  - **output.file_name**: Name of the output files.

Output files
------------

By default, CarboLoad will generate a PDB file with the loaded carbohydrates and
the linking files. These are no longer required by ``phenix.refine`` but are
instructive.
