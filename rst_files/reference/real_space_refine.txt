phenix.real_space_refine: a tool for refinement a model against a map
=====================================================================

**Description**

The program refines a model into a map. The map can be derived from
X-ray or neutron crystallography, or Electron Microscopy, and its quality can be
from very good to poor. The goal is to obtain a model that fits map as good as
possible and that has a meaningful geometry (no stereochemically impossible
outliers, such as Ramachandran plot outliers, etc that are not justified by the
map).

**Features**

  - Fast gradient-driven minimization of combined map and restraints target
  - Local grid search based fit to fix rotamer outliers or poor map-to-model fit
  - Morphing (map guided rigid body shifts of small continuous model fragments)
  - Simulated Annealing refinement
  - Rigid-body refinement
  - Restraints: Standard set: bond, angle, planarity, chirality, dihedral,
    nonbonded repulsion. Extra restraints: Ramachandran plot (two options:
    "oldfield" and "emsley"), C-beta deviations, rotamer, secondary structure,
    starting position
  - Fast and fully automated restraints/map weight optimization
  - Support for maps having non-zero origin
  - Efficient handling of high-order NCS
  - Map can be provided as CCP4 formatted map or as MTZ file with Fourier map
    coefficients
  - ADP (B-factors) can be refined against the map
  - Fast calculations
  - Input PDB file may contain full molecule or only one NCS copy and NCS
    operators (that generate whole molecule from one NCS copy). NCS operators
    need to be stored as MTRIX records in PDB file header

**Usage examples**

  1) Running with default settings::

       phenix.real_space_refine model.pdb map.ccp4 
       
       phenix.real_space_refine model.pdb map_coefficients.mtz

     This will do several macro-cycles of global real-space refinement with
     secondary structure, rotamer, Ramachandran plot and C-beta deviations
     restraints enabled.

  2) Disabling secondary structure, rotamer and Ramachandran plot restraints::

       phenix.real_space_refine model.pdb map.ccp4 \
       secondary_structure_restraints=False use_rotamer_restraints=False \
       ramachandran_restraints=False

  3) Request output model to have bond and angle rmsd from ideal not greater
     than certain values::

       phenix.real_space_refine model.pdb map.ccp4 target_bonds_rmsd=0.01 \
       target_angles_rmsd=1.0

  4) Specify which Fourier map coefficients to use::

       phenix.real_space_refine model.pdb map.mtz label='2FOFCWT,PH2FOFCWT'

  5) Run refinement using global minimization (default), local fitting, morphing,
     and simulated annealing::

       phenix.real_space_refine model.pdb map.ccp4 \
       run=minimization_global+local_grid_search+morphing+simulated_annealing

  6) If PDB file contains unknown to Phenix ligand a ligand CIF file needs to
     be provided. Ligand CIF file can be obtained using one of corresponding
     tools in Phenix (see documentation for more details). Once CIF file is
     available it can be used as following::

       phenix.real_space_refine model.pdb map.ccp4 ligands.cif
       
  7) Group ADP (B-factor) refinement. Currently only one option availbale: 
     restrained group ADP refinement with two B-factors per residue (one for 
     main and one for side chains)::
     
       phenix.real_space_refine model.pdb map.mtz run=adp

**Notes**

  - Secondary structure (SS) restraints strongly rely on correct SS annotation.
    If SHEET and HELIX records are available in PDB file header then
    they will be used to enforce SS as defined. Incorrect SHEET and HELIX
    records are very likely to result in incorrect refined structure. If SHEET
    and HELIX records are not present in PDB file header and SS restraints are
    enabled then KSDSSP tool will be used internally to annotate SS and use it
    as restraints. The outcome of KSDSSP strongly depends on input model quality:
    for a model with gross errors SS annotation may be inaccurate resulting in
    poorly refine model.

  - Including local fitting, morphing, or simulated annealing (
    local_grid_search+morphing+simulated_annealing) into refinement may
    significantly increase runtime.

  - It is possible to extract a box with map and model in it and do refinement
    inside of that box. To extract box with map and model use phenix.map_box
    command (see Phenix documentation for more details).

  - It is important that information provided in CRYST1 record in PDB file (if
    provided) matches box information of CCP4 formatted map or crystal symmetry
    information in MTZ file (whatever used).
