===================
Sorting heteroatoms
===================

The program ``phenix.sort_hetatms`` is a utility designed to re-group the
non-polymeric molecules (heteroatoms) in a model in a roughly similar manner
to the format used by the Protein Data Bank.  This consists of matching all
heteroatoms to the nearest polymer chain, resetting the chain IDs and
residue numbers, converting ATOM labels to HETATM, and optionally sorting
waters by B-factor.  It is primarily intended or internal use, and is also
run within `phenix.ligand_pipeline <ligand_pipeline.html>`__.  The only
input required is a PDB file, since the program does not deal with molecular
geometry or experimental data.  Any REMARK records will be removed, but this
can be disabled by setting ``preserve_remarks=True``.

Note that the PDB will, inevitably, further modify the contents of the model
according to its own rules.  However, the program output is significantly
closer to the PDB conventions than the output of phenix.refine or similar
programs.
