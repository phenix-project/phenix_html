Purpose
-------

The find_ncs method identifies NCS in (a) the chains in a PDB file or (b) a set of heavy-atom sites, or (c) from the density in a map and writes out the NCS operators in forms suitable for phenix.refine, resolve, and the AutoSol and AutoBuild Wizards.


How find_ncs works
------------------

The basic steps that the find_ncs carries out are:

- Decide whether to use simple_ncs_from_pdb (used if the input file contains chains from a PDB file) or RESOLVE NCS identification (used if the input file contains heavy-atom sites) or find_ncs_from_density (used if a map is supplied and sites are not found from either of the above)

- call either simple_ncs_from_pdb or RESOLVE or find_ncs_from_density to identify NCS

- Evaluate the NCS by calculating the correlation of NCS-related electron density based on the input map coefficients mtz file.

- Report the NCS operators and correlations

Output files from find_ncs
--------------------------

The output files that are produced are:

- NCS operators written in format for phenix.refine: find_ncs.ncs

- NCS operators written in format for the PHENIX Wizards: find_ncs.ncs_spec

What find_ncs needs
-------------------

- find_ncs needs a file with map coefficients and optionally a second file containing NCS information.

The file with NCS information can be...

- a PDB file with a model (find_ncs will call simple_ncs_from_pdb to extract NCS operators from the chains in your model)

- a PDB file with heavy-atom sites (find_ncs will call RESOLVE to find NCS operators from your heavy-atom sites)

- an NCS definitions file written by a PHENIX wizard (e.g., AutoSol_1.ncs_spec, produced by AutoSol)

- a RESOLVE log file containing formatted NCS operators

Map coefficients file
---------------------

The file with map coefficients can be any MTZ file with coefficients for a map. If find_ncs does not choose the correct columns automatically, then you can specify them with a command like:

labin="labin FP=FP PHIB=PHIB FOM=FOM "

If you have no map coefficients yet (you just have some sites and want to get operators, for example), you can tell find_ncs to ignore the map with:

ncs_parameters.force_ncs=True

You still need to supply a map coefficients file (the map itself will be ignored though).

Examples
--------

Standard run of find_ncs
------------------------

If you have just a map coefficients file you can say:

phenix.find_ncs mlt.mtz

and find_ncs will look for NCS-related density in mlt.mtz (see find_ncs_from_density for more details on how this works)

If you have a model and a map file, from the command-line you can type:

phenix.find_ncs anb.pdb mlt.mtz

This will produce the following output::

  Getting column labels from mlt.mtz for input map file
  FILE TYPE:  ccp4_mtz
  All labels:  ['FP', 'SIGFP', 'PHIC', 'FOM']
  Labin line will be:  labin FP=FP PHIB=PHIC FOM=FOM
  To change it modify this: params.ncs.labin="labin FP=FP PHIB=PHIC FOM=FOM "
  This is the map that will be used to evaluate NCS

  Reading NCS information from:  anb.pdb
  Copying  mlt.mtz  to  temp_dir/mlt.mtz
  This PDB file contains 2  chains and  636  total residues
  and  636  C-alpha or P atoms  and  4740  total atoms
  NCS will be found using the chains in this PDB file
  Chains in this PDB file:  ['M', 'Z']
  Two chains were found in the file anb.pdb, chain M and chain Z

  GROUPS BASED ON QUICK COMPARISON: []
  Looking for invariant domains for ...: ['M', 'Z'] [[[2, 138], [193, 373]], [[2, 138], [193, 373]]]
  Residues 2-138, 193-373, matched between the two chains

  Copying  mlt.mtz  to  temp_dir/mlt.mtz
  Copying  temp_dir/NCS_correlation.log  to  NCS_correlation.log
  Log file for NCS correlation is in  NCS_correlation.log
  List of refined NCS correlations:  [1.0, 0.80000000000000004]
  There were two separate groups of residues that had different NCS
  relationships. Residues 193-373 of each chain were in one group, and
  residues 2-138 in each chain were in the other group.

  The electron density map had a correlation between the two NCS-related
  chains of 1.0 for the first group, and 0.8 for the second

  The NCS operators for each are listed.
