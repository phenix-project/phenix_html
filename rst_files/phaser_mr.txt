Molecular replacement with the Phaser GUI
=========================================

Although the `AutoMR wizard <automr.htm>`_ presents a user-friendly and
automated frontend to Phaser, especially difficult cases may require finer
control over parameters.  The Phaser-MR GUI exposes all options available in
the standalone command-line Phaser software, and allows use of additional
modes besides MR_AUTO.  It can, for instance, be used to search for individual
components one at a time with modified parameters, or run each stage of the
search (rotation, translation, packing, phasing+refinement) separately.

This document only covers configuration of the Phaser GUI; for a detailed
explanation of the various terms and search procedures referenced here as well
as interpretation of results, consult the
documentation for `AutoMR <automr.htm>`_ or `Phaser <phaser.htm>`_, or the
`Phaser WIKI <http://www.phaser.cimr.cam.ac.uk/index.php/Phaser_Crystallographic_Software>`_.

Input files and mandatory parameters
------------------------------------

The input section is similar to that of AutoMR, with separate sections for
reflection data, search ensembles, and ASU components.  Unlike the command-line
version of Phaser, the experimental data may be any file format, and both
intensities and amplitudes (with or without anomalous data) are allowed.
The default mode is "Automated molecular replacement" (MR_AUTO); some of the
other modes require only a subset of the parameters displayed.

All modes require a description of the search ensembles, either
as PDB files (singly, or superimposed as an ensemble), or map coefficients in
MTZ format (e.g. for phasing using a low-resolution EM map).  Adding an
ensemble does not automatically include it in the search; you may, for
instance, supply several alternate ensembles for a chain, and instruct Phaser
to try each in turn (see below).

|br|
You must also define the composition of the asymmetric unit (ASU); this is
usually done by supplying information for each chain as a sequence, mass, or
type and number of residues.  Alternately, you may give the fractional
composition of each search ensemble, if known.  It is also possible to
additionally specify heavy atoms that contribute to scattering, but this is
rarely necessary.  Note that the composition data does not necessarily have
a 1:1 correspondence with the search ensembles; for instance, an ensemble
might be made up of two chains, each of which is defined as a separate
component using sequence files.  Even if you are only searching for a single
ensemble out of several (e.g. the protein in a protein-DNA complex), you
must still supply the expected composition of the entire crystal.

|br|
Finally, the "Search procedure" tab defines the steps in the MR search,
selected from each input ensemble.  Enabling more than one ensemble per
search will result in the single best solution being used.  You do not need
to search for all ensembles at once, as described below.

Additional parameters
---------------------

The "Output" button at the top of the window controls basic behavior such as
the resulting file names and verbosity.  All other parameters are set by
clicking the "Other settings" button, which will open a large dialog window
with assorted controls.  (Like most such windows in the Phenix GUI, only
a subset of basic controls may be displayed at first, but this can be changed
by selecting options in the "User level" menu at the bottom of the window.)
The available parameters will be slightly different depending on which mode
you have selected.

Re-using previous results
-------------------------

Phaser can be instructed to start from a previous partial solution; this does
not use a partial PDB file, but rather the saved results of a previous run.
For example, a two-part MR solution may be obtained by running in MR_AUTO
mode to place one ensemble, then modifying the parameters, selecting the
previous run as the partial solution, and searching for the second ensemble.
To do this, click the "Partial solution" button and select the result which
you want to use as input (all previous Phaser jobs for the current project
will be listed).

You may also run each mode separately, e.g. the fast rotation function
followed by the fast translation function using the previous result, and so
on.  There are some restrictions on which modes may use which results, thus
you may not follow a fast rotation function with packing analysis.
