The phenix.refine graphical interface
=====================================

GUI overview
============

The graphical interface for *phenix.refine* runs the unmodified command-line
version; default settings are unchanged.  All parameters should be
configurable through the GUI, although some of these (such as NCS restraint
groups) are handled in a non-standard way.  This document describes the
behavior of the GUI only; see the `phenix.refine <refinement.htm>`_
documentation for details on specific parameters and methods.

At present the GUI has the following capabilities:

  - automatic extraction of parameters from PDB and reflection files
  - detection of unknown ligands, and generation of restraint files
  - graphical mirroring and picking of any atom selection
  - project-specific default settings and restraints
  - NCS restraint group detection and editing tool
  - real-time visualization of current model and maps during refinement
  - model validation using programs from the Molprobity server
  - graphical comparison of structure quality measures
  - printable plots of final statistics

Configuration
=============

Because phenix.refine currently has nearly 500 distinct parameters, many
of which rarely need changing, and the window controls are mostly created
automatically, advanced settings are hidden by default.  The "user level"
may be set within each window, or set globally in the Preferences.
The most important parameters (input and output files, strategy, additional
procedures such as solvent updating and simulated annealing) are shown
in the main window.

Input files
===========

The first tab contains settings for input files, which can be added by
clicking the "+" button below the file list, or by dragging files into the
list control and releasing the mouse button.  Up to five different reflection
files may be used (X-ray data, X-ray R-free flags, neutron data, neutron
R-free flags, and experimental phases), but in most cases all data will be
in a single file.  Any number of PDB files for the starting model may be
added; these will be combined internally.  You may also specify a reference
model for additional restraints (see below).  Other supported file formats
are CIF (restraint) files for non-standard ligands, and phenix.refine
parameter files.

.. image:: images/refine_gui_files.png

The GUI will attempt to guess the purpose of PDB and X-ray files, but you may
change this by right-clicking on the "Data type" field associated with the
file and selecting an option from a drop-down menu, or select the file and
click the button labeled "Modify file data type".

If your reflection and/or PDB files have the appropriate information on
crystal symmetry and data labels, these parameters will be extracted
automatically.  Appropriate column labels for reflection files will also be
added to the drop-down menus; by default, anomalous intensities (I+/I-) will
be used if present, but you may also use merged data and/or amplitudes.  The
R-free flags are optional, since phenix.refine will add them automatically if
none are present, but once flags have been used in refinement (including the
automated building in AutoSol or AutoBuild) the same set should always be used.

Refinement settings
===================

The second tab contains options for the refinement protocol.  Many of these
controls will open additional dialog windows in response to mouse clicks
or file selection.  In many cases, you can open these windows on demand
by right-clicking on the appropriate control (for instance, right-clicking
the "Rigid body" strategy button will show the atom selection controls for
defining rigid groups).  All other parameters can be found in the *Settings*
menu.

.. image:: images/refine_gui_options.png

The first set of controls determines the parameterization of the model and
the attributes to be refined.  By default, the Individual Sites, Individual
ADPs (B-factors), and Occupancies strategies are selected, since these are
usually appropriate at a wide range of resolutions and refinement stages.
All strategies have associated atom selections which control what parts of
the model are refined.  A brief summary follows; note that the resolution
limits specified are approximate only, and in practice may vary widely
depending on model quality, data quality, and observation-to-parameters ratio.

  - **Individual sites** is standard Cartesian refinement of model geometry
    and agreement with X-ray data.  It is almost always appropriate except
    at low-resolution (typically 3.5A or worse), unless additional restraints
    (NCS, reference model, etc.) are used.

  - **Real-space** is similar to the Individual Sites strategy, but refines
    against the map instead of in reciprocal space.  This is generally not
    useful as a global strategy, but real-space refinement is used in other
    parts of phenix.refine for local optimization.

  - **Rigid-body** refines the position of large, user-defined regions of the
    model without changing geometry.  It is typically used immediately after
    molecular replacement, when the R-factors are usually very high, and at
    very low resolutions (4.5A or worse).  If both rigid-body and individual
    sites refinement are checked (recommended), the rigid-body step will be
    done first, in the first cycle of refinement.

  - **Individual ADPs** is atomic B-factor refinement, and is always
    appropriate except at low resolution (3.5A or worse).  Whether atoms are
    treated as isotropic or anisotropic is defined separately (see below).

  - **Group ADPs** refines B-factors for multiple atoms at a time, most often
    single residues either as a whole or divided into mainchain and sidechain.
    (Larger user-defined groups are also allowed.)  This is usually only
    necessary at low resolution (3.5A or worse).

  - **TLS parameters** refines anisotropic displacements for large groups of
    atoms, typically individual domains or chains.  Because this introduces
    only ten parameters for each group, and relatively few groups are used,
    it is appropriate at almost any resolution unless individual anisotropic
    B-factors are refined.  (See note about B-factors below.)  It is important
    to provide accurate atom selections here; the TLSMD server may be
    helpful in determining these automatically.

  - **Occupancies** refines atomic occupancies.  This is appropriate at
    high resolution (usually 1.7A or better) where alternate conformations
    are often present, and in situations where a ligand, ion, or solvent atom
    is not bound in every unit cell.  By default, it will only be performed
    for atoms with partial occupancies.  Groupings are determined automatically
    if possible, but you may specify them manually.  (This is especially
    important if you have complex relationships betweeen alternate
    conformations in different parts of the model.)

  - **Anomalous groups** refines the anomalous coefficients f' and f'' for
    anomalously scattering atoms such as Se or heavy metals; it is only
    appropriate if you have anomalous data (I+/I- or F+/F-).

The refinement protocol can be further modified by manipulating various
restraints (structural and otherwise):

  - **NCS restraints** preserves non-crystallographic symmetry between
    identical copies of a molecule.  These can be automatically detected or
    defined manually.  If NCS is present in the crystal, these restraints are
    usually appropriate at intermediate resolution (2.2-2.7A or worse) and
    essential at lower resolutions.

  - **Find NCS restraints automatically** instructs phenix.refine to run
    a built-in NCS identification protocol at the start of refinement; it
    is ignored if NCS restraints are not activated.  Note that this should
    be disabled if you have already defined NCS restraints in the GUI!

  - **Reference model restraints** use the dihedral angles of an existing
    structure as restraints on the input model conformation, for instance,
    refining a low-resolution structure of a molecule whose high-resolution
    structure is available.  This is most useful at low resolutions (usually
    worse than 3.0A).

  - **Secondary structure restraints** add distance restraints for hydrogen
    bonds in alpha helices, beta sheets, and Watson-Crick base pairs.  These
    are helpful for maintaining correct geometry at lower resolutions (2.5A
    or worse).  Suitable atom selections will be detected automatically but
    you may also specify them manually.

  - **Ramachandran restraints** guide protein backbone phi/psi angles towards
    the optimal regions of the Ramachandran plot.  This can be very useful at
    low resolutions (usually worse than 3.0A), although it will not by itself
    eliminate outliers.

  - **Use experimental phases** uses the experimental phase distributions
    (Hendrickson-Lattman coefficients) from phasing programs such as AutoSol
    as additional restraints during refinement.  This is usually helpful if
    these phases are avilable, but only if the same data were used for both
    phasing and refinement.

Several other options are available for the types of optimization and restraints
used; these typically apply globally, except as noted.

  - **Automatically add hydrogens to model** runs phenix.ready_set to add
    hydrogen atoms (or deuteriums, if performing neutron crystallography)
    where appropriate.  This usually only affects the R-factors at high
    resolution, but can be very helpful for improving geometry at any
    resolution.  We recommend using explicit hydrogens throughout refinement.
    (Note that this can be left on if you already have hydrogen atoms in
    place.)  Hydrogen atoms will still be defined using the "riding" model
    unless otherwise requested, so they do not add parameters during
    refinement.

  - **Update waters** automatically adds and removes solvent atoms as
    necessary; this is usually appropriate at any resolution where water
    molecules are visible in density (usually 2.5A or better).

  - **Simulated annealing** uses molecular dynamics with an extra X-ray
    term as an additional optimization method.  It is very helpful for
    removing phase bias and overcoming energy barriers, and often yields a
    significant improvement over simple minimization early in refinement.
    The main disadvantage is speed.  Two types of parameterization are
    available, **Cartesian** and **torsion angles**; the latter is more
    suitable for low resolution.

  - **Fix bad sidechain rotamers** adjusts sidechain torsion angles to agree
    with the distribution of conformations in the PDB and the electron density,
    if possible, and performs local real-space refinement to optimize the
    fit.  It is most useful at intermediate-to-high resolution (2.5A or
    better), where sidechain density is clearly visible.

  - **Automatically correct N/Q/H errors** uses the program Reduce to flip
    backwards sidechains, which appear symmetric when explicit hydrogens are
    not present.  This is almost always a good idea and adds very little to
    overall run time.

  - **Model interatomic scattering** adds the contribution of electrons
    in atomic bonds to the model-derived X-ray ampltidues; it is only
    appropriate at ultra-high resolution (at least 0.9A).

  - **Target function** describes the calculation of model-based X-ray
    terms; "ML" means "Maximum likelihood" and is usually appropriate;
    "MLHL" use used when experimental phase restraints are added; "ML-SAD"
    is not suitable for general use.  The least-squares (LS) target is
    only useful for twinned refinement or very small datasets (it will be
    used automatically if necessary).

  - **Scattering table** determines how atomic scattering is modeled; this
    is almost always either "n_gaussian" for standard X-ray refinement, or
    "neutron" (see below).

The output tab allows you to change the destination directory and modify the
default map coefficients and/or map files written out.  By default, an MTZ
file containing 2mFo-DFc and mFo-DFc map coefficients will be generated.

Creating restraints
===================

If the PDB file contains ligands or prosthetic groups that are not part of
the limited monomer library distributed with PHENIX, a warning message will
be displayed when the file is loaded.  The necessary restraints must be
generated by *phenix.elbow* in order for refinement to proceed.  To start
this process, click the *ReadySet* button in the toolbar or choose
"Prepare structure and restraints" from the *Utilities* menu.  This will
launch a dialog for running *phenix.ready_set*, a simple utility for
preparing structures for phenix.refine.

.. image:: images/ready_set.png

Generating the restraints will take between 30 seconds and several minutes,
depending on computer speed and the size of the ligand.  When ReadySet is
finished, another window will be displayed summarizing the results.  If
a project directory is defined, these can be saved for future runs and
will be automatically loaded into the GUI when launched.

If your input model does not contain hydrogen atoms and you would like to
use them in refinement, this can also be done via the ReadySet dialog, or
by clicking the box labeled "Automatically add hydrogens to model" in the
main window.

Neutron crystallography
=======================

*phenix.refine* can perform refinement using either X-ray data, neutron
diffraction data, or both.  You can change the type of data contained in a
reflections file by right-clicking on the "Data type" field in the file list.

At present, *phenix.refine* always requires that you define an X-ray dataset;
this constraint will be removed in future versions.  If you are performing
refinement against neutron data alone, you must treat the reflections as if
they were X-ray data.  All of the data options remain the same, and will
be extracted automatically.  You must change the scattering table to
"neutron" in the "Refinement settings" tabe.
If you are doing joint X-ray/neutron refinement,
you should leave the scattering table set to the default, and specify one
reflections file as neutron data.  Parameters for neutron data
are not chosen automatically; once you have specified a neutron reflections
file, click the "Neutron data. . ." button to select the column labels for
the data and test set.

If you need to add hydrogens and deuteriums to your model before running
phenix.refine, you can either run *ReadySet* prior to refinement, or change
the options for automatic hydrogen addition.  If your model already includes
these atoms, you may wish to turn automatic hydrogen addition off to ensure
that existing atom types are left in place.

Atom selection
==============

The atom-selection syntax used by PHENIX is described in the
`phenix.refine manual <refinement.htm#anch297>`_.  In the GUI, any valid
atom selection can be visualized if you have a suitable graphics card
and have already loaded a PDB file with valid symmetry information.  The
graphics window can be opened by clicking the "View/pick" button next
to any atom selection field.  Depending on the size of your structure, it
may take several seconds for PHENIX to determine the atomic connectivity.
The current selection, if any, will be highlighted:

.. image:: images/gui_atom_selection.png

The *Select atoms* button opens a window that allows you to type in
selections and immediately visualize the results, including the number of
atoms selected.  On mice with at least two buttons, clicking on an atom
with the right button will open a menu for selecting residue ranges or
chains.  However, we
recommend that you learn the selection syntax, as it is much more flexible
than mouse controls.  Selections made in the graphics window will be sent
automatically to the appropriate control.

Once this window is open, it does not need to be closed; clicking a different
"View/pick" button will transfer control of the display.  (On Linux, you
will first need to open the *Actions* menu and click *Restore parent window*
to transfer mouse and keyboard controls back to the configuration dialog.)

Running phenix.refine
=====================

Each time phenix.refine is run from the GUI, a new folder is created
(in the current output directory) named *Refine_X*, where X is an integer
corresponding to the job ID.  This directory will contain all temporary and
output files created during the course of the run.  Existing folders will not
be overwritten.  All output files will be displayed in the GUI in the results
tab.

Once you are done configuring refinement, switch to the *Run* tab in the
main window and start the process by clicking the "Run" button.  The
log output will appear at the bottom of the new tab:

.. image:: images/refine_run.png

Statistics will be continually updated; any that appear to be outliers
(e.g. excessively high R-factors) will be highlighted in red.  If an
error occurs during refinement, a message box will pop up and the process
will be halted.

After refinement
================

Once the refinement is complete, additional tabs will appear.  The first
of these is a summary page displaying the final statistics, a list of
output files, buttons for opening the refined structure in Coot and PyMOL,
and links to assorted graphs.  Note that the output files may include one
ending in "_data.mtz"; if you did not specify R-free flags as part of the
input, the new file will contain the automatically generated flags, and should
be re-used in future runs.

.. image:: images/refine_summary.png

Additional tabs contain the full `validation summary <validation.htm>`_,
which is essentially identical to the standalone validation program.
