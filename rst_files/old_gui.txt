Purpose
-------

To provide a simple and easy graphical interface to the features of the
PHENIX package. In particular, the concept of a wizard that guides the
user through the complex process of solving a protein structure, is a
powerful tool.

Wizards
-------

Wizards can be loaded by double clicking on the Wizard menu to the left
of the GUI. The wizard loads and provides an interface to request
information from the user. Details on wizards can be found in:

-  `Using the PHENIX Wizards <running-wizards.htm>`__
-  `Automated Structure Solution using AutoSol <autosol.htm>`__
-  `Automated Molecular Replacement using AutoMR <automr.htm>`__
-  `Automated Model Building and Rebuilding using
   AutoBuild <autobuild.htm>`__
-  `Automated Ligand Fitting using LigandFit <ligandfit.htm>`__

Strategies
----------

The main window of the PHENIX GUI is the strategy canvas. The strategy
canvas allows the user to construct a strategy from the tasks in the
menu in the left window. Choosing a task from the menu will attach that
task to the mouse. The mouse will change to a hand icon while in the
canvas window and there is a task attached. Clicking inside the canvas
will place the task on the closest grid point. Help on tasks can be
obtained by right-clicking on the task menu item to reveal a pop-up
menu.

A similar situation exists for the strategy menu. Choosing a strategy
will load it into a new strategy canvas. These strategies are loaded
with the default task inputs providing a "clean slate" strategy for user
customization. Right-clicking will reveal a pop-up menu for strategy
loading option including overwriting the current strategy or adding to
the current strategy.

Tasks can be moved in one of two ways. The first involves using the left
mouse button to click-drag-drop the task. This must be done in the title
panel of the task. The second option is useful in situations where there
is a delay between the mouse action and the GUI update. This happens
when using a remote machine to run the GUI. Moving a task can be achieve
by right mouse clicking on the title panel and then right clicking where
the task should be re-located. The mouse cursor will change to indicate
the attachment of the task.

Each task has up to five buttons along the top of the title panel. The
right most button deletes the task from the canvas. The left most button
is a toggle to indicate which task to commence the calculation. The
remaining three buttons are present if the appropriate function is
available for that task.

The upper-most task in the above figure displays all five buttons. The
second button is the task parameter button. A dialog is displayed that
allows the user to edit the input and output of that task. The number
and type of information is dependent on the task.

The third button is the display button. This launches the appropriate
windows for display the results of a task. For example, the 'import pdb'
task will display the PDB header information in a text control or the
molecule in a molecular graphical interface program PyMOL.

The fourth button is the help button. Help for the task is displayed via
this option.

Two tasks can be linked by moving the lower panels of one task over the
title panel of another. There can be any number of connection panels
associated with a task. Logical operations can be provided to choose the
appropriate linkage to follow.

The connection between tasks is not data flow but time flow. Each task
obtains its data from the PHENIX Data Storage Server and sends its
output data to the PDS server. Subsequent tasks can get data sent to the
PDS server by previous tasks.

The colors of the task indicate the activity of the strategy. A purple
task means that it has finished running. The green task is the currently
running task and blue indicates a task that hasn't been run. Red
indicates a task that failed during calculation and yellow is used when
a strategy run is stopped by the user.

The task menu on the left side of the strategy canvas is divided into
sub-menus. The \`\`development\`\` sub-menu contains experimental tasks.
The \`\`examples\`\` sub-menu has some demonstrative tasks. The
remaining sub-menus are self explanatory.

The overview window in the bottom left corner allows navigation of the
canvas when large strategies are used.
