General issues
--------------

**How do I know if Phaser has solved my structure?**

This is answered in
detail in the section "Has Phaser solved it?" in the `main Phaser manual
<phaser.htm>`_, but it can be summarized as follows: the final translation
function Z score (TFZ) should be above 8, and the log-likelihood gain
(LLG) should be positive and as high as possible.  Of course, as with
experimental phasing, the ability to `autobuild most of the model
<autobuild.htm>`_ is the single best measure of a correct solution;
alternately, running a single round of `refinement <refine_gui.htm>`_
should result in an R-free below 0.50.

**Why doesn't Phaser report an R-factor?**

The R-factor is far less
sensitive than the TFZ and LLG scores, especially when searching for
remote homologs or a small part of the overall scattering mass.  Phaser
does record R-factors for the rigid-body refinement step towards the
end of a run, which can be found in the logfile.  However, unless these
values are relatively low (< 40%), they are not reliable indicators of
solution quality, which is why only the Z-scores and LLG are reported in
the GUI.

**What if I don't get a good solution?**

This is also covered in detail
in the `main Phaser manual <phaser.htm>`_, in the section "What to do in
difficult cases".

**What resolution cutoff should I use?**

By default Phaser uses all
data to 2.5 A.  We recommend leaving the resolution alone, but in some
cases reducing it may improve results (it will also lead to a significant
improvement in speed).  The effects of bulk solvent at low resolution are
already taken into account internally, so you do not need to specify
a low-resolution cutoff either.

**Should I use the output MTZ file from Phaser for refinement?**

No, the amplitudes (Fs) in this file have been corrected for anisotropy, which
is helpful for the MR search but may significantly alter them from the
experimental values.  The MTZ file is only useful for map coefficients,
but in most cases you will find that much better maps can be obtained by
immediately running a round of refinement or automated re-building.

**How are the composition and search ensembles related?**

Technically, they aren't connected.  The ensembles are used in the actual MR
search;
the composition only tells Phaser what to expect for the overall scattering
mass of the asymmetric unit (an important factor in the maximum likelihood
scoring).  Although you may only specify one sequence per component, you
can instead provide a molecular weight for a collection of chains.  You
may also split a model into smaller ensembles (for instance, different
domains) while keeping the composition the same, or use a multi-chain
search model while specifying a sequence file for each chain.

**How can I make Phaser go faster?**

The new MR_FAST mode will reduce the
redundancy of multi-copy TF searches, and can significantly reduce overall
runtime.  In many cases, adjusting the resolution limit will dramatically
increase speed, at some cost to accuracy (depending largely on model
similarity).

**Can PHENIX do MRSAD?**

Yes, PHENIX can run MRSAD (molecular replacement, combined with SAD
phases) by determining the anomalous scatterer substructure from a
model-phased anomalous difference Fourier.  However, this requires two
separate steps.
There two simple ways to do this; both are described in the `AutoSol
documentation <autosol.htm>`_.

**I am using a dimer as my search model.  Why am I getting a warning that the
unit cell is too full?**

Remember, the composition of the asymmetric unit is specified independently
of the model.  If you have supplied a single sequence to define the
composition, Check to make sure that you have specified that the contents
of the unit cell include two copies.

Phaser-MR GUI
-------------

**Do I actually have to include multiple models in my ensembles?**

No, we use "ensemble" in this context to refer to any search model; in many
cases a single model is adequate to solve the structure (and these may
be much easier to work with).

**What is the difference between "high resolution" and "high resolution for
refinement"?**

The latter is applied during the "refinement and phasing"
step only; for rotation and translation searches, the first parameter is
used.

**How do I search for multiple unique ensembles?**

The "Search procedure" tab allows you to set up this procedure.  To search for
multiple independent ensembles representing different entities in a
complex ("a AND b AND c"), click the "Add search"
button below the tab, and for each search, check the ensemble(s) to be
used at that step.  The searches will be performed in the order they appear
in the GUI.  Note that this is **not** the same as checking multiple
ensembles for a single search, as described in the next question.

**How do I tell Phaser to pick the best solution from among several similar
ensembles?**

To try multiple alternative ensembles (corresponding to the same actual
entity in the crystal) at once ("a OR b OR c"), check the
box next to each ensemble you want Phaser to try for a single search; only
one of these will actually be placed in the output model.
(You can, of course, specify any combination of searches and ensembles,
for instance "(a OR b) AND c", which would be two separate search
instructions.)

**I want to run a new search in Phaser starting from the results of a
previous job.  How do I specify this?**

If the previous job was run in
the Phenix GUI, you can select it from the drop-down menu labeled "Use
partial solution from previous job" in the "Input and general options" tab.
This will automatically load the solution.  Note that unlike the CCP4i
interface, Phaser-MR in Phenix does not make use of .sol files, since the
information is passed internally.  You should then load the new ensembles
to search for; ensembles that were used in the previous run do not need to
be re-loaded unless you wish to find more copies.  However, you must
provide complete information about the composition, including previously
placed components.

**How do I run a new search starting from an existing model in the correct
orientation and translation?**

This might apply if you have a refined
model, or a solution from another program.  In this case, you should
add the model as an ensemble, and check the box "Ensemble is fixed partial
solution".  This will instruct Phaser to accept the input coordinates
without modification, and skip to the next ensemble to search for.  You
do not need to specify a separate search for this ensemble, as it will
be included automatically.

MR-Rosetta
----------

**Why does mr_rosetta bomb and say "error while loading shared libraries:
libdevel.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory"?**

This may indicate that somewhere your system is defining the shared libraries
that Rosetta needs, and these are for a place that is not where Rosetta
expects them to be. You can try to ignore the previous definitions
this way:

If you are using the bash or sh shells::

  export PHENIX_TRUST_OTHER_ENV=1

or csh (C-shell)::

  setenv PHENIX_TRUST_OTHER_ENV 1

in the script where you run mr_rosetta, or before you run it from the command
line.

**Why does mr_rosetta or mr_model_preparation bomb and say
"RuntimeError: Cannot contact EBI DbFetch service"?**

This could mean just what it says...but also it could mean
that you are behind a firewall and there is a proxy server you need
to go through. You can use the following
command to specify the proxy server (replacing it with YOUR proxy server).

If you are using the bash or sh shells::

  export HTTP_PROXY=proxyout.mydomain.edu:8080

or csh (C-shell)::

  setenv HTTP_PROXY proxyout.mydomain.edu:8080

**Problems installing Rosetta? Here are some suggestions:**

- Download rosetta_source and rosetta_database separately.  The bundle
  doesn't contain all the files.

- Compilation fails on RHEL 6.1 (gcc 4.5 issue) but sails on RHEL 5.5.

- Make sure the environment is set correctly: ``$PHENIX_ROSETTA_PATH``
  must point to the Rosetta installation directory
  (where rosetta_source and rosetta_database sit). (Note there was a typo
  in documentation with ROSETTTA instead of ROSETTA; fixed now.)

- all directories in the Rosetta installation must be made accessible to
  users::

    find $PHENIX_ROSETTA_PATH -type d -exec chmod 755 '{}' \;
