=======================================
Glossary of common terms used in PHENIX
=======================================

**2mFo-DFc map**: one of the most common types of **Sigma-A weighted** maps
generated by modern refinement programs, and the primary map used for manually
inspecting and building the model in between rounds of refinement.  **Fo** and
**Fc** are the experimentally measured and model-based amplidues, respectively
(Fc here is synonymous with **F(model)**).  **m** is the **figure of merit**,
and **D** is the **Sigma-A weighting** factor.  The effect of this combination
of factors will be to amplify the regions of the map in which portions of the
true model are missing, and to better account for errors in the model-based
amplitudes.  This is technically a type of **difference map**, although the
term is often used specifically to refer to **mFo-DFc** maps and similar.
Usually viewed at between 1.0 to 1.5 **sigma** (the latter is the default in
Coot).

**Anisotropic**: not equal in all directions, or in practice, ellipsoidal in
shape.  In crystallography this is used in two very different contexts:

  - **Anisotropic B-factors** model the atomic displacement as an ellipsoid,
    which introduces six parameters per atom (versus one for
    isotropic B-factors).  This is more accurate, but refinement of individual
    B-factors using this parameterization is only possible at atomic resolution
    (approximately 1.5A or better, depending on data quality and solvent
    content).  At moderate resolution, **TLS** parameters for groups of atoms
    can be refined instead.

  - **Anisotropic data** does not extend to the same resolution in all
    directions; typically, the anisotropy is along the direction of the
    unit cell axes (or h,k,l in reciprocal space).  This is an effect of
    varying crystal quality.  Programs such as phenix.refine and Phaser will
    perform anisotropic scaling during phasing, refinement, and map generation
    to compensate for some of the effects of anisotropy, but in some cases
    the diffraction images will need to be processed specially.

(right) B-factors for a high-resolution structure*

**Anomalous scattering**: a phenomenon in which the scattering of X-rays by
electrons has both imaginary and real components, leading to breaking of
**Friedel's law**.  Anomalous scattering is most pronounced in heavy atoms and
is wavelength-dependent; each atom has several "edges" at which the effect
reaches a maximum.  The change in scatttering at a given wavlength is
represented by two numbers, f' (f-prime), which describes the "dispersive
difference" or change in the real component, and f'' (f-double-prime), which
describes the "anomalous difference" or change in the imaginary component.
Anomalous scattering has several uses:

  - The result will be small but measurable differences in Friedel pairs (F+
    and F-), which can be exploited to locate the heavy-atom substructure and
    phase the entire structure, as used in **SAD** and **MAD** phasing methods.

  - Anomalous data may also be used after phases are available to calculate an
    **anomalous difference map**, which also shows the location of heavy
    atoms.  Because this map is automatically calculated in phenix.refine and
    is very useful in completing the model, we recommend refining against
    anomalous data if available, even if no additional anomalous scatterers
    were introduced as part of the experiment.

  - In addition to map calculation, it is also possible in phenix.refine to
    refine the anomalous scattering of specific atoms, which may be more
    accurate than using the non-anomalous **scattering factors.**

  .. image:: images/anom_map.png

*Example of an anomalous difference map, calculated from data collected at
the selenium K edge (approximately 0.9792A wavelength) on a
selenomethionine-derivatized protein crystal.  The anomalous map is rendered
in purple, contoured at 3.0 sigma, and clearly shows the positions of the
Se atoms in the structure.*

**B-factors** or **Atomic Displacement Parameters (ADPs)**: B-factors or ADPs
describe the variability or uncertainty in atomic positions, and (unlike
**occupancy**) have a resolution-dependent effect on the diffraction amplitude.
The simplest
model for these (**isotropic**) is a sphere centered around the atomic position,
but at high resolution (approximately 1.5A or better) it becomes possible to
model them as ellipsoids (**anisotropic**).  At low resolution (worse than
3-3.5A) it may be necessary to refine ADPs for small groups such as entire
residues, instead of individual atoms.  The total ADPs will also include
contribution from larger displacements such as those modeled by TLS
refinement and an overall anisotropic ADP for the entire crystal.  (Note that
in other contexts, "ADP" may instead mean "anisotropic displacement parameter".)

**Bijvoet mates**: F+ and F-, which are related by **Friedel's law**, except to
the extent that **anomalous scattering** is present.  Also sometimes called
"Friedel pairs".

**Bulk-solvent correction**: Scaling of low-resolution model-based amplitudes,
F(calc), to account for the effects of unmodelled disordered solvent in the
crystal.  Because the bulk solvent comprises such a large scattering mass in
macromolecular crystals, and the low-resolution reflections tend to dominate
the R-factor calculations, the correction step significantly decreases the
R-factors and is an essential step during refinement and map calculation.

**Clashscore**: a validation statistic used in the `Molprobity web server
<http://molprobity.biochem.duke.edu>`_ and the related `validation tools
<validation.htm>`_ in Phenix (on the command line, the program
``phenix.clashscore`` can also be used).  It is equal to the number of severe
atomic clashes (overlaps greater than 0.4A) per 1000 atoms.  A well-refined
structure should have a clashscore below 20; clashscores of zero are
exceptionally uncommon and very difficult to obtain.  Note that while the
VDW restraints used in refinement will help prevent the clashscore from
increasing, many severe clashes will require manual rebuilding to fix.  Clashes
can be visualized in KiNG or Coot as "Probe dots"; these will be generated by
Phenix as part of validation.

  .. image:: images/probe_dots.png

*Example of Probe dots for a severely misfit sidechain.  The severe clashes
(many caused by overlapping hydrogen atoms, not shown) are displayed as pink
lines; these count towards the total clashscore.*

**Constraints**: In refinement, constraints force specific parameters to be
refined together.  Examples of this include rigid-body refinement (atomic
coordinates constrained), "riding" hydrogen atoms, or grouped ADPs.  Since
constraints reduce the number of refined parameters, they are particularly
useful at low resolution. See also **restraints**.

**Crystallographic Information Format (CIF)**: a type of structured file
format developed specifically for crystallography.  Although CIF files may be
used to represent any type of data, they are most commonly used in Phenix to
define **geometry restraints**, which are generated primarily by `eLBOW
<elbow_gui.htm>`_.  They are also used by the PDB to store reflection data
(these files may be read directly by most programs in Phenix, or
converted to MTZ format) and coordinate data (which phenix does not
actively use at the moment).

**Density modification**: A statistically-based method of phase improvement by
real-space manipulation of electron density, which dramatically improves
experimentally phased maps.  For SAD phasing, density modification is essential
to resolve phase ambiguity and obtain an interpretable map, but it is also
very helpful for other methods.

**Difference map**: any map calculated from the difference in amplitudes
between two sets of structure factors (with phases from one of these, or from
an external source).  This can include an **anomalous difference map**, which
shows the location of anomalously scattering atoms, an **isomorphous difference
map**, which shows atoms present in one crystal but not another, or any of
several types of maps which show the difference between the experimental data
and the model, of which the **mFo-DFc map** is the most common.  (When used
without qualifications, the term "difference map" will often simply refer to
the mFo-DFc map.)

**Direct methods**: a phasing method based on mathematical relationships
between reflections, which does not require any additional information beyond
the diffracted amplitudes.  Direct methods are standard for small-molecule
crystallography, but because they require atomic-resolution data and only work
for relatively small structures (typically 1000 atoms or less), they are rarely
able to phase protein crystal data.  However, they can be used to locate heavy
atom sites if anomalous data of sufficient quality are available; in Phenix,
the program HySS uses direct methods to perform the heavy-atom search.
Herbert Hauptman and Jerome Karle won the `Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1985
<http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1985/>`_ for their
work related to direct methods in reciprocal space. However, direct
methods are more intuitively understood in the direct-space formulation,
based on the Sayre equation.

**Experimental phasing**: umbrella term for a variety of phasing methods based
on exploiting the scattering of heavy atoms (the heavier the better, but even
endogenous atoms such as sulfur may be used in favorable cases).  Includes
**SAD**, **MAD**, and **isomorphous replacement**.  The majority of new
structures are determined by **molecular replacement**, which is usually
significantly easier if a similar structure has already been solved, but
experimental phasing is usually the only option for genuinely novel structures,
and has the added advantage of avoiding **model bias** in the resulting
phases, especially at lower resolution.

**f-prime (f') and f-double-prime (f'')**: see **anomalous scattering**.

**Figure of Merit (FOM)**: An approximate measure of phase quality, calculated
for each reflection.  Range is from 0 to 1, higher being better.  The FOM is
defined as the expected value (probability-weighted average) of the cosine of
the phase error; Blow & Crick showed that if this weight is applied to terms in
an electron density calculation, the RMS error in the density is minimized.
Although it is sometimes reported in the context of refinement and density
modification, it is only useful for evaluating initial experimental phases.  A
good MAD solution will typically have an FOM greater than 0.4, while a SAD
solution should usually be greater than 0.3.

**F(model)**: the structure factors calculated from the model, which in this
context also includes the bulk-solvent contribution.  Sometimes also referred
to as "F(calc)".

**Friedel's law**: a phenomenon in which pairs of refections related by
a center of inversion, (h,k,l) and (-h,-k,-l), have identical amplitudes
(but conjugate phases).  Anomalous scattering breaks the Friedel
symmetry, which can be taken advantage of to locate heavy-atom sites and
phase the structure.

**Hendrickson-Lattman coefficients**: Phase probability parameters, calculated
either experimentally based on heavy-atom methods (SAD, MAD, etc.) or directly
from the model, used in density modification and (if experimentally obtained)
as additional restraints during refinement.  Consists of four coefficients per
reflection, which describe a bimodal phase distribution.  (If calculated from
a model, the distribution will in fact be unimodal, but the same representation
is used by convention.)

**Insertion code**: a single column in the ATOM records of a PDB file, used to
supplement the residue number.  Insertion codes are used when a specific
numbering convention is desired, e.g. to preserve the identity of key residues
in related proteins, or to reflect an expressed sequence modified from the
genomic equivalent.  In these cases, consecutive residues might be numbered
25, 26, 26A, 26B, 26C, 27, etc.  When defining atom selections in Phenix,
the syntax "``icode A``" is used; the insertion code can also be combined with
the residue number to uniquely identify a residue, using the syntax
"``resid 26A``".

**Isomorphous**: geometrically similar, which in the context of crystallography
means that the space group is the same and the unit cell parameters are nearly
the same between two crystals/datasets.  The degree to which the unit cell
parameters are allowed to deviate before datasets are considered
non-isomorphous may depend on the specific method being used to compare or
combine the datasets, but the maximum permissible change in unit cell length
is usually 1% (other rules based on resolution are also sometimes used).  By
default many programs in Phenix use very strict rules for determining
isomorphism, although some of these can be modified or ignored.

**Isomorphous replacement**: an older method for phasing protein
crystal structures, in which a native dataset is collected, followed by one
or more heavy-atom derivatives that are isomorphous to the native data, and
the differences in amplitudes are used to locate the heavy-atom substructure
and calculate experimental phases.  For many years isomorphous replacement
was the standard tool for phasing, but it is very time-consuming compared to
SAD or MAD, let alone molecular replacement, and is rarely used now except
for very difficult structures.  Several variants exist: SIR (single
isomorphous replacement), which like **SAD** requires density modification to
resolve the phase ambiguity; MIR (multiple isomorphous replacement); and
SIRAS or MIRAS, in which the anomalous signal of the heavy atoms is also
employed.  In Phenix, isomorphous replacement is performed by the `AutoSol
<autosol_gui.htm>`_ wizard.

**Isotropic**: moving equally in all directions.  In crystallography, this
is usually used to describe the simplest (and most common) parameterization of
B-factors or atomic displacement parameters (ADPs).  Only one parameter per
atom is refined, the
mean atomic displacement **u** (where B = 8 * pi^2 * u^2).  Visually, the
B-factor is represented as a sphere.  See also **anisotropic** and **TLS**.

**Kicked map**: A faster alternative to omit maps.  All coordinates are
shaken randomly by a small amount, and the map recalculated; this is done
repeatedly and the maps averaged.  This can help remove bias and in some cases
noise as well.  Available in both `phenix.refine <refine_gui.htm>`_ and
`phenix.maps <create_maps.htm>`_.

**Least squares**: an older refinement methodology, no longer in widespread
use for macromolecular crystallography.  A least-squares target assumes that
the error in experimental observations takes a Gaussian distribution; modern
maximum-likelihood targets do a better job weighting the observations and
accounting for sources of error.  (The optimization methods used, such as
minimization or simulated annealing, are the same regardless of the specific
target.)  In Phenix, a least-squares target is still used when performing
twinned refinement, or refinement against a very small number of reflections.

**Log-likelihood gain (LLG)**: a statistical measure used by Phaser; in the
context of molecular replacement, it essentially scores the model placement
in comparison to a random model.  The LLG should be positive and relatively
large if the MR solution is correct.

**Map coefficients**: This is simply the Fourier coefficients for an
electron density map, in MTZ format.  Graphics programs such as Coot (and
PHENIX, internally) will perform the Fourier transform automatically to obtain
the real-space density.  Most programs in PHENIX output map coefficients
rather than pre-calculated maps, but the terms are often used interchangeably.

**Maximum likelihood**: The statistical methodology used in target functions
for refinement and phasing, in which the probability of the model given the
data is maximized.  Maximum likelihood is much better at weighting the data
appropriately than the previously used least-squares method, and leads to
greater sensitivity and improved maps.  See `McCoy Acta Cryst. (2004). D60,
2169-2183 <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15572770>`_ for an introduction
to the method as used in crystallography.

**mFo-DFc map**: the other most common type of map generated by refinement
programs, along with **2mFo-DFc**.  Colloquially called a "difference map",
although technically 2mFo-DFc maps also fall into this category.  The mFo-DFc
map is usually viewed at positive and negative contours (typically +/- 3 sigma).
The positive density indicates features present in the data that are not
accounted for by the model; the negative density indicates parts of the model
that are not supported by the data.  Note that in a well-refined structure
some residual difference density is always expected, and interpretation of
the maps needs to also take into account the 2mFo-DFC map and local model
features.

  .. image:: images/difference_map.png

*An example of 2mFo-DFc and mFo-DFc difference maps.  The 2mFo-DFc map is
colored blue and contoured at 1.0 sigma (i.e. 1.0 standard deviations above the
mean electron density), and shows where we expect most of the model to be
(excluding hydrogen atoms, not included here).  The mFo-DFc map is colored
green (3.0 sigma) and red (-3.0 sigma); the green mesh shows where atoms
are missing in the current model, while the red mesh shows where atoms are
present in the model but not the crystal.  In this image, the central Tyr
rotamer is clearly misfit, as is the carboxyl group of the Glu sidechain in
the upper left corner.*

**Miller array**: Any set of **reciprocal-space** data indexed by ``h,k,l``
("Miller indices"). This can include experimental intensities or amplitudes,
phases, weights (such as FOM), Hendrickson-Lattman coefficients, R-free flags,
etc.  These are the basic unit of reflection data in PHENIX, and may combine
multiple columns from the input file (for instance, F and SIGF in an MTZ file
will be grouped into a single Miller array containing both amplitudes and
sigmas).

**MIR**: see **Isomorphous replacement**.

**Model bias**: a term used to describe the phenomenon in which the phases
calculated based on the model will tend to result in an electron density map
that resembles the model, regardless of the amplitudes used.  Several
excellent 2D examples of this can be viewed on `Kevin Cowtan's Book of
Fourier <http://www.ysbl.york.ac.uk/~cowtan/fourier/fourier.html>`_.  In
macromolecular crystallography, model bias is often a serious concern due to
the limited resolution of most datasets, and maps calculated using model
phases need to be interpreted with a healthy amount of skepticism.  Methods
for minimizing model bias include the calculation of **omit maps** or the use of
**experimental phases**.  At atomic resolution model bias is less problematic,
but for low-resolution structures (especially below 3.0A) the effect is both
pervasive and difficult to avoid.

**Molecular replacement (MR)**: the most popular phasing method, accounting for
more than three-quarters of all new PDB depositions.  MR uses known structures
to phase (and also provides an initial model for refinement), by determining
their rotation and translation in the unit cell of the collected data.  Unlike
other phasing methods (SAD, MAD, MIR, etc.), MR does not require a special
experimental setup or especially high-quality data.  The search model may
either be a single PDB file, an ensemble of superimposed PDB files of similar
structure, or a processed electron density map (containing only the region of
interest).  The search model is often nearly identical to the target structure
(e.g. when the goal is a known protein in complex with a ligand, or a point
mutant), but search models with sequence identities as low as 30-40% are
usually still easily solved, and significantly lower-identity models may still
be used with additional processing (particularly trimming non-conserved loops
and the ends of non-identical side chains in Sculptor) if their structures are
similar enough.  In Phenix, MR is performed by `Phaser <phaser_mr.htm>`_ and
various procedures that invoke Phaser.

**MTZ**: a binary format for reflection data, developed as part of the
`CCP4 suite <http://www.ccp4.ac.uk>`_.  It can contain essentially any
combination of data commonly used in refinement, including amplitudes or
intensities (with or without sigmas), phases, **Hendrickson-Lattman
coefficients**, and various integer arrays (including **R-free** flags).
Each one-dimensional data array in an MTZ file has a unique "column label",
although Phenix will often work with groups of these arrays, for instance
grouping "F" and "SIGF" together if they appear sequentially in the file.
MTZ files are usually the prefered format for reflections files, as they are
very versatile, reasonably compact, and supported by a wide range of modern
software, including Phenix, CCP4, and Coot.

**Multi-wavelength Anomalous Difraction (MAD)**: a popular method for
experimental phasing using heavy atoms.  MAD takes advantage of the tunability
of synchrotron beamlines to collect data for (ideally) a single crystal at
multiple wavelengths (at least two, but rarely more than four), clustered
around the anomalous "edge" of the heavy atom of interest (most commonly
selenium, but any element whose edge is accessible with synchrotron radiation is
suitable, including many heavy metals).  The differences in anomalous
scattering around the edge allow calculation of phase angles without the
phase ambiguity present in **SAD** experiments, although density modification
will usually still be necessary to obtain an easily interpretable map.
Because of the sensitivity to small differences in f' and f'', which diverge
significantly from theoretical values around the anomalous edges, these values
should be experimentally measured at the beamline (or suitable approximations
obtained from beamline staff).  Although very powerful, MAD phasing has
declined somewhat in popularity relative to SAD because of the more limited
choice of heavy atoms, the difficulty of avoiding radiation damage, and the
requirement for a synchrotron beamline, but it is still a much easier method
than **isomorphous replacement**.  In Phenix, MAD is performed by the
`AutoSol wizard <autosol_gui.htm>`_, using the underlying program SOLVE.

**Non-crystallographic symmetry (NCS)**: Symmetry within a crystal that is
independent of the lattice type; this is very common in biomolecules,
especially homo-oligomeric proteins.  Information about NCS can be used to
great advantage during density modification, and as additional restraints on
the conformation of
related groups during refinement.  (PHENIX does not currently support NCS
constraints, which force related molecules to be identical.)  NCS is most
easily identified by comparing chains in a model, but can also be detected by
analysis of heavy-atom sites or even electron density; several tools exist in
Phenix for this purpose, and it can be performed automatically by the
`AutoSol wizard <autosol_gui.htm>`_ and `phenix.refine <refine_gui.htm>`_.
See the `refinement FAQs <refine_faq.htm>`_ for additional information about
the use of NCS restraints.

**Occupancy**: an attribute of atoms in a structure, equal to the fraction of
unit cells in which the atom occurs in the given position.  High-resolution
structures (usually 1.6A or better) will often need occupancy refinement for
sidechains that occur in more than one conformation, or for ligands that
are not 100% bound.  The occupancy should never be set to zero in a deposited
structure.  Note that B-factor and occupancy are correlated in practice and
the effects of each may be difficult to tell apart; however, partial occupancy
has an equal effect at any resolution, unlike the B-factor whose effect is
resolution-dependent.

**Omit map**: a map generated by deleting part of the structure (for instance,
a bound ligand) and recalculating phases and F(calc).  This almost always
involves simple refinement of the modified structure to remove phase bias, and
simulated annealing is recommended for best results.  A variant, the
**composite omit map**, stitches together the contribution of many individual
omit maps, which collectively omit all atoms.  In PHENIX, these may be
calculated using the `AutoBuild <autobuild_gui.htm>`_ wizard.  See also the
entry for "kicked map".

**Overfitting**: Optimization of R-work at the expense of other quality
metrics, especially R-free.  The most obvious indication of overfitting is
divergence of R-work and R-free, which ideally should decrease in sync
throughout refinement.  In most cases, the solution is to add or tighten
restraints, or reduce the number of refined parameters.

**Phasing**: determination of the missing phase angles to accompany the
experimentally measured amplitudes.  Obtaining the phases allows calculation
of the Fourier transform of the reflection data to obtain the electron density
into which a model can be built.  Several methods for reconstructing the
phases are possible (covered elsewhere in this document): **Molecular
replacement**, experimental phasing (**SAD**, **MAD**, or **isomorphous
replacement**), and **direct methods** (which is not generally useful for
most macromolecular structures).  For crystals that are essentially
isomorphous to a known structure, the previously determined phases (often in
the form of a model) can also be used directly.

**Radius of convergence**: a term used to describe how far a model can be
improved from a given starting point.  The larger the radius of convergence,
the worse a starting model can be without stalling refinement, and the better
the result.  The radius of convergence is affected by multiple refinement
options, including the choice of strategy (for instance, rigid-body refinement
has a very large radius of convergence for crude models), the optimization
target, and the optimization method.  Simple gradient minimization usually
has a smaller radius of convergence than simulated annealing and grid search
methods (such as rotamer fitting), but it is usually significantly faster to
run.  When a structure is described as being "beyond the radius of
convergence" of a program, this means that it cannot be improved by
automatic methods.  Programs such as `MR-Rosetta <mr_rosetta.htm>`_ are
designed to have a very wide radius of convergence, although at the cost of
long run times.

**Ramachandran plot**: a two-dimensional graph of the phi,psi angle
combinations of their allowed backbone; also refers to the expected/allowed
distribution of points on this graph.  This distribution is dictated by
steric constraints on the backbone conformation, originally identified by
`Ramachandran et al. (1963) J Mol Biol 7:95-99
<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/13990617>`_.  Because the Ramachandran
plot is an essential validation metric, phi and psi are typically left
unrestrained during refinement.  In the `Molprobity server
<http://molprobity.biochem.duke.edu>`_ and the Phenix validation tools, the
plot is divided into "favored", "allowed", and "outlier" regions; a
well-refined structure should have 98% of residues favored, and less than 0.2%
outliers, although at lower resolutions it may be difficult to obtain these
statistics.  Note that the expected distribution varies depending on residue
type and environment; in the current version of Phenix, six different
distributions are used.

  .. image:: images/ramachandran.png

*A representative Ramachandran plot, with outliers shown in red; the
contours define the borders of the favored and allowed regions.*

**Real space**: coordinates in the crystal (relative to an origin which may
be somewhat arbitrary depending on the space group).  Examples of real-space
data are model coordinates and electron density maps.

**Reciprocal space**: a mathematical construction describing the
positions of reflections in a "reciprocal lattice", whose parameters are
directly related to the crystal lattice parameters; the reciprocal
lattice vectors are perpendicular to real-space planes.  The dimensions
in reciprocal space are expressed in terms of 1/Angstrom, i.e. the
reciprocal of the resolution for a given reflection, and positions are
indexed by the **Miller indices** ``h, k, l``.  The process of data
collection can be thought of as sampling reciprocal space, which rotates
along with the crystal lattice.

**Restraints**: In refinement, restraints keep specific independent parameters
from diverging too far.  At most resolutions, basic geometry restraints
(bonds, bond angles, dihedral angles, chiral centers, planar groups, and
VDW interactions) and ADP similarity restraints will be used, usually taking
the form of a simple harmonic potential, mimicking a spring pulling
parameters back to ideal values.  Depending on
the specific structure and data, additional restraints may include experimental
phase distributions (see **Hendrickson-Lattman coefficients**) or restraints
between related molecules (**NCS** or a reference structure).  Restraints do
not reduce the number of refined parameters, but are essential to maintain
proper geometry and prevent overfitting.  However, they become less necessary
as resolution increases, and restraining a high-resolution model too tightly
will actually make it worse.  See also **constraints**.

**R-factor**: Crystallographic residual, equal to sum(abs(abs(Fobs)-abs(Fcalc))) /
sum(abs(Fobs)).
R-merge, R-sym, etc. are calculated similarly using redundant observations
instead of Fc.  Generating Fc at random will typically result in an R-factor
of 0.55, which is therefore the threshold for determining if a model is placed
correctly.  (Note that in practice, molecular replacement solutions often have
higher starting R-factors, but these will rapidly drop during refinement if
the solution is correct.)

**R-free**: R-factor calculated from reflections not used in refinement,
typically 5-10% of the data or 1000-2000 reflections (in statistical
terminology this is called "cross-validation").  If the refinement was
parameterized appropriately, the R-free should be reduced along with the
R-factor for the "working" set (R-work), although it will always be a higher
value.  An increase in R-free indicates an incorrect optimization, even if
R-work decreases.  A large spread between R-work and R-free is a primary
symptom of overfitting.  See `Brunger AT (1992) Nature 355:472-475
<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18481394>`_ for full rationale.

**R-free flags**: an integer array that marks each reflection for use in
either refinement or the calculation of **R-free**.  Usually a set of R-free
flags is generated at the beginning of the model-building and refinement
process, and used throughout (usually as part of a single MTZ file including
experimental data); programs such as `AutoSol <autosol_gui.htm>`_,
`AutoBuild <autobuild_gui.htm>`_, and `phenix.refine <refine_gui.htm>`_ will
do this automatically if no flags have previously been generated.  Extension of
an existing set of flags to higher resolution, or transfer to an
**isomorphous** dataset, can be done by the `reflection file editor
<reflection_file_editor.htm>`_.

**Rotamer**: A well-defined unique combination of dihedral angle values in
a group of atoms; the term is almost always used in reference to amino acid
sidechains, although RNA backbone angles are also rotameric.  The sidechain
rotamers used in Phenix are extracted from a set of
high-quality, high-resolution structures (the Top500 database).  The vast
majority of sidechains in a finished structure should be recognizably
rotameric unless the density very clearly supports an outlier conformation,
and flagging of rotamer outliers is an important part of `validation
<validation.htm>`_.
Because the standard geometry restraints and minimization methods often do a
poor job moving sidechains into rotameric positions, a separate
rotamer-fitting step is available in ``phenix.refine``.

**Rotation function (RF)**: the first part of molecular replacement, which
establishes the rotational orientation of the search model in the crystal.
This is independent of the exact space group in some cases, e.g. the
same rotation will be correct whether the space group is P6(2) or P6(4).
The resulting **Z-score** is only a weak indicator of whether the
rotation is correct or not, i.e. a high Z-score does indicate a correct
rotation, but a rotation with a low Z-score may well be correct too.

**Scattering factors**: values describing the scattering of X-rays by
a given atom type, related to the number of electrons in the atom or ion.
These are used in refinement to calculate the
expected electron density and structure factors given a set of atomic
parameters (XYZ coordinates, B-factor, occupancy, and possibly anomalous
scattering).  A variety of parameterizations of scattering factors are
available in Phenix, but the most commonly used (for X-ray refinement) is
called "n_gaussian".  Scattering factors for neutron diffraction experiments
(where the nucleus, rather than the electrons, is responsible for the
scattering) are also available.

**Sigma**: a common shorthand term for standard deviation.  May occur in
several contexts in macromolecular crystallography, most commonly referring
to the **sigma-scaling** of maps.

**Sigma-A weighting**: a method of weighting difference map coefficients to
more accurately account for errors in the model.  This is standard practice
in macromolecular crystallography, as it leads to improved maps.  A sigma-A
weighted map will typically described as "2mFo-DFc" or "mFo-DFc", with the "D"
being the relevant value ("m" is the **Figure of Merit** for each reflection).
The maximum likelihood target in Phaser is a derivation of this methodology.
See Read, R.J.: Acta Cryst. A42 (1986) 140-149 for original derivation.

**Sigma scaling**: a method of scaling electron density maps in real space, in
which the statistics for the entire unit cell are calculated, and the grid
point values are set to the number of standard deviations (sigmas) from the
mean value.  Although this can
be thought of as crude normalization, and the maps are commonly viewed at
standard sigma levels (e.g. the Coot defaults of 1.5 sigma for **2mFo-DFc**
and +/- 3.0 sigma for **mFo-DFc** maps), the sigma values are actually very
subjective, depending greatly on solvent content and model quality.

**Simulated annealing**:
An optimization method which simulates heating up a system and
slowly cooling it down, as a way of escaping local energy minima trapping
simple gradient-based minimization methods.  In crystallography, this means
running a simple molecular dynamics simulation starting at very high
temperatures (2500-5000 K), with the agreement with X-ray data included as an
additional pseudo-energy term.  Especially useful for poorly built structures
early in refinement, and as a method to remove phase bias (e.g. for omit maps).
In PHENIX, both Cartesian and torsion-angle dynamics are available; the latter
is intended for low-resolution refinement as it uses fewer parameters.
However, in practice Cartesian simulated annealing in phenix.refine
often outperforms torsion-angle dynamics.

**Single-wavelength anomalous diffraction (SAD)**: probably the most popular
experimental phasing method currently in use, SAD requires only a single
wavelength from one crystal.  The experimental phases themselves will be of
poor quality because the SAD experiment cannot resolve the phase ambiguity,
but density modification will lead to a significantly improved map in most
cases.  SAD is often performed with selenomethionine-incorporated protein,
but any anomalously scattering atom (including sulfur, if the data are of
very high quality) may be used.  In Phenix, SAD may be performed by either
the `AutoSol wizard <autosol_gui.htm>`_ or `Phaser-EP <phaser_ep.htm>`_,
although the latter only calculates initial phases and completes the heavy-atom
substructure, whereas AutoSol will also perform initial heavy-atom location,
density modification, and preliminary model-building.

**Skew**: Statistic derived from the distribution of electron density values
in an experimentally phased map.  The skew describes the deviation from a
Gaussian distribution; a correct map will have a slight skew towards higher
values.  A skew above 0.2 is usually indicative of successful phasing.

**SMILES string**: a simple textual representation of molecular structure,
originally developed by `Daylight Chemical Information Systems
<http://www.daylight.com>`_ and now in wide
use by the chemistry community.  Although SMILES strings do not encode
coordinates, unlike PDB files they uniquely encode the connectivity of
molecules, and can optionally even specify chirality.  They are therefore one
of the prefered input formats for eLBOW.  As an example, the SMILES string for
benzene is ``c1ccccc1``.

**Special positions**: locations on crystallographic symmetry elements.
For macro-molecular structures special positions are always on rotation
axes (2, 3, 4, 6-fold rotations); for small-molecule structures special
positions may also be on centers of inversions, mirror planes, and
roto-inversions. Atoms on special positions are restricted in the way
they can move during refinement. For example an atom on a 2-fold axis
can only move along the axis. It is also possible that atoms or
molecules are disordered around special positions; in this case the
occupancy found in the PDB file is usually 1/N or smaller, where N is
the order of the rotational symmetry.

**Structure factors**: the individual reflections corresponding to the Fourier
transform of the electron density of the crystal.  Both **F(obs)** and
**F(model)** are examples of structure factors, based on the true and
model-based electron density, respectively.  The term encompasses both the
amplitudes and phases, although for the experimental structure factors, only
the amplitudes can be measured directly.  The amplitude alone is usually
represented by the "abs()" operator.

**Translation function (TF)**: the second step of molecular replacement, which
starts from the output of the **rotation function** and determines the exact
position of the search model within the unit cell.  The TF may be significantly
more time-consuming than the RF, because a separate translation search must be
run for each possible orientation indicated by the RF, but it can resolve
space-group ambiguity, and the resulting Z-score (TFZ), in combination with the
**LLG**, will usually be sufficient to determine whether the solution is
correct or not.

**Translational non-crystallographic symmetry (TNCS)**: a common crystal pathology in which
the unit cell size is effectively doubled due to a near-symmetric translation
operator which breaks higher symmetry.  The effect of this on data is to double
the number of reflections, with the additional reflections systematically
weaker.  TNCS can be detected by this signature, and by the presence of a large
off-origin peak in the Patterson map; `Xtriage <xtriage_gui.htm>`_ is used in
Phenix for this purpose.  Although not as severe as twinning, TNCS
can cause problems during phasing and (to a lesser extent) refinement, because
it breaks some of the assumptions used in the maximum-likelihood equations used
in Phenix.  This is now handled by Phaser for molecular replacement and SAD
phasing.  See `Zwart et al. (2008) Acta Cryst D. 64:99-107
<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18094473>`_ for more information.

**Translation, Libration, and Screw (TLS)**: A way of describing anisotropic motion
for rigid groups of atoms which move collectively in the crystal.  These are
usually separate chains, or domains in a flexible protein, but there is no
restriction on the size of groups.  Refining TLS parameters will result in
all atoms that are part of a TLS group being treated as anisotropic - in this
sense, it is essentially constrained anisotropic refinement.  Because it
only adds twenty parameters per group, TLS refinement is suitable for almost any
resolution.  (Note that while ``phenix.refine`` allows you to perform
either TLS or anisotropic refinement for separate atom selections within a
single run, the two methods may not be combined, as they effectively refine
the same parameters.)

**Twin law**: an operator describing the relationship between distinct
reflections due to **twinning**.  Each lattice has a limited set of
permitted twin laws, which can be identified by `Xtriage <xtriage_gui.htm>`_.
These are typically represented in terms of **Miller indices**, for example,
the R3 space group has the allowed merohedral twinning operator ``-h-k,k,-l``,
which signifies that the ``h,k,l`` reflection will be actually be overlapped
in reciprocal space with ``-h-k,k,-l``.  The twin law can be used during
refinement if necessary, although some caution should be taken when doing this.
In rare cases a crystal can be a multiple twin, with more than one
twin law.  Note that phenix.refine does not currently support multiple
twin laws.

**Twinning**: a common crystal pathology in which different regions of the
crystal assume different orientations.  In the simplest case, epitaxial
twinning, this is simply two or more crystals stacked together, without
superimposed lattices, and the result is multiple distinct lattices visible in
the diffraction pattern, which can often be handled by data processing
programs.  Merohedral twinning preserves the overall lattice symmetry, so
that the diffraction spots contain the contribution of two or more "twin
domains" which cannot easily be disambiguated.  Small twin fractions (perhaps
10% or less) are not usually problematic and can easily be overlooked.
Larger fractions, up to 50% ("perfect twinning"), can make experimental
phasing very difficult, and result in abnormally high R-factors and poor map
quality during refinement.  This can be handled by refining with a twin law,
although this needs to be performed with caution.  Twinning is usually
easily detected by the systematic deviation from expected intensity statistics;
in Phenix, `Xtriage <xtriage_gui.htm>`_ is the program used to diagnose and
analyze possible twinning.  See `Zwart et al. (2008) Acta Cryst D. 64:99-107
<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18094473>`_ for more information.

**Wilson plot**: a plot showing the average intensity value for each
resolution bin (typically using a relatively large number of bins, e.g. 30).
Among other things, the Wilson plot shows the falloff of intensity with
resolution due to the B-factors of the atoms, and can be used to determine an
approximate overall B-factor for the data.  Because of the non-random
distribution of atoms in the unit cell, the Wilson plot has a distinctive
appearance, especially for protein and nucleic acid structures, and deviations
from the expected plot may indicate data pathologies.
