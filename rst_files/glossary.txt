Glossary of common terms used in PHENIX
=======================================

**Atomic Displacement Parameters (ADPs)**: Also known as B-factors, ADPs
describe the variability or uncertainty in atomic positions.  The simplest
model for these (**isotropic**) is a sphere centered around the atomic position,
but at high resolution (approximately 1.5A or better) it becomes possible to
model them as ellipsoids (**anisotropic**).  At low resolution (worse than
3-3.5A) it may be necessary to refine ADPs for small groups such as entire
residues, instead of individual atoms.  The total ADPs will also include
contribution from larger displacements such as those modeled by TLS
refinement and an overall anisotropic ADP for the entire crystal.

**B-factors**: see ADPs.

**Constraints**: In refinement, constraints force specific parameters to be
refined together.  Examples of this include rigid-body refinement (atomic
coordinates constrained), "riding" hydrogen atoms, or grouped ADPs.  Since
constraints reduce the number of refined parameters, they are particularly
useful at low resolution. See also **restraints**.

**Figure of Merit (FOM)**: An approximate measure of phase quality, calculated
for each reflection.  Scale is from 0 to 1, higher being better.  Although it
is sometimes reported in the context of refinement and density modification,
it is only useful for evaluating initial experimental phases.  A good MAD
solution will typically have an FOM greater than 0.4, while a SAD solution
should usually be greater than 0.3.

**Hendrickson-Lattman coefficients**: Experimental phase probability values,
used in density modification and as additional restraints during refinement.

**Kicked map**: A faster alternative to omit maps.  All coordinates are
shaken randomly by a small amount, and the map recalculated; this is done
repeatedly and the maps averaged.  This can help remove bias and in some cases
noise as well.  Available in both `phenix.refine <refine_gui.htm>`_ and
`phenix.maps <create_maps.htm>`_.

**Map coefficients**: This is simply the Fourier coefficients for an
electron density map, in MTZ format.  Graphics programs such as Coot (and
PHENIX, internally) will perform the Fourier transform automatically to obtain
the real-space density.  Most programs in PHENIX output map coefficients
rather than pre-calculated maps, but the terms are often used interchangeably.

**Miller array**: Any set of data indexed by ``h,k,l`` ("Miller indices").
This can include experimental intensities or amplitudes, phases, weights
(such as FOM), Hendrickson-Lattman coefficients, R-free flags, etc.  These are
the basic unit of reflection data in PHENIX, and may combine multiple columns
from the input file (for instance, F and SIGF in an MTZ file will be grouped
into a single Miller array containing both amplitudes and sigmas).

**Non-crystallographic symmetry (NCS)**: Symmetry within a crystal that is
independent of the lattice type; this is very common in biomolecules,
especially homo-oligomeric proteins.  Information about NCS can be used during
density modification, and as additional restraints on the conformation of
related groups during refinement.  (PHENIX does not currently support NCS
constraints, which force related molecules to be identical.)

**Omit map**: a map generated by deleting part of the structure (for instance,
a bound ligand) and recalculating phases and F(calc).  This almost always
involves simple refinement of the modified structure to remove phase bias, and
simulated annealing is recommended for best results.  A variant, the
**composite omit map**, stitches together the contribution of many individual
omit maps, which collectively omit all atoms.  In PHENIX, these may be
calculated using the ``AutoBuild <autobuild.htm>`_ wizard.  See also the entry
for "kicked map".

**Restraints**: In refinement, restraints keep specific independent parameters
from diverging too far.  At most resolutions, basic geometry restraints
(bonds, bond angles, dihedral angles, chiral centers, planar groups, and
VDW interactions) and ADP similarity restraints will be used.  Depending on
the specific structure and data, additional restraints may include experimental
phase distributions (see **Hendrickson-Lattman coefficients**) or restraints
between related molecules (**NCS** or a reference structure).  Restraints do
not reduce the number of refined parameters, but are essential to maintain
proper geometry and prevent overfitting.  However, they become less necessary
as resolution increases, and restraining a high-resolution model too tightly
will actually make it worse.  See also **constraints**.

**Simulated annealing**: An optimization method which heats up a system and
allows it to slowly cool, as a way of escaping local energy minima where
simple gradient-based minimization fails.  In crystallography, this means
running a simple molecular dynamics simulation starting at very high
temperatures (~2500 K), with the agreement with X-ray data included as an
additional pseudo-energy term.  Especially useful for poorly built structures
early in refinement, and as a method to remove phase bias (e.g. for omit maps).
In PHENIX, both Cartesian and torsion-angle dynamics are available; the latter
is intended for low-resolution refinement as it uses fewer parameters.

**Turn, Libration, and Screw (TLS)**: A way of describing anisotropic motion
for rigid groups of atoms which move collectively in the crystal.  These are
usually separate chains, or domains in a flexible protein, but there is no
restriction on the size of groups.  Refining TLS parameters will result in
all atoms that are part of a TLS group being treated as anisotropic - in this
sense, it is essentially constrained anisotropic refinement.  Because it
only adds ten parameters per group, TLS refinement is suitable for almost any
resolution.
