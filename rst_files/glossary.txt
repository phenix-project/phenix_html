Glossary of common terms used in PHENIX
=======================================

**Anisotropic**: not equal in all directions, or in practice, ellipsoidal in
shape.  In crystallography this is used in two very different contexts:

  - **Anisotropic B-factors** model the atomic displacement as an ellipsoid,
    which introduces six parameters per atom (versus one for
    isotropic B-factors).  This is more accurate, but refinement of individual
    B-factors using this parameterization is only possible at atomic resolution
    (approximately 1.5A or better, depending on data quality and solvent
    content).  At moderate resolution, **TLS** parameters for groups of atoms
    can be refined instead.

  - **Anisitropic data** does not extend to the same resolution in all
    directions; typically, the anisotropy is along the direction of the
    unit cell axes (or h,k,l in reciprocal space).  This is an effect of
    varying crystal quality.  Programs such as phenix.refine and Phaser will
    perform anisotropic scaling during phasing, refinement, and map generation
    to compensate for some of the effects of anisotropy, but in some cases
    the diffraction images will need to be processed specially.

**Anomalous scattering**: a phenomenon in which the scattering of X-rays by
electrons has both imaginary and real components, leading to breaking of
**Friedel's law**.  Anomalous scattering is most pronounced in heavy atoms and
is wavelength-dependent; each atom has several "edges" at which the effect
reaches a maximum.  The change in scatttering at a given wavlength is
represented by two numbers, f' (f-prime), which describes the "dispersive
difference" or change in the real component, and f'' (f-double-priume), which
describes the "anomalous difference" or change in the imaginary component.
Anomalous scattering has several uses:

  - The result will be small but measurable differences in Friedel pairs (F+
    and F-), which can be exploited to locate the heavy-atom substructure and
    phase the entire structure, as used in **SAD** and **MAD** phasing methods.

  - Anomalous data may also be used after phases are available to calculate an
    **anomalous difference map**, which also shows the location of heavy
    atoms.  Because this map is automatically calculated in phenix.refine and
    is very useful in completing the model, we recommend refining against
    anomalous data if available, even if no additional anomalous scatterers
    were introduced as part of the experiment.

  - In addition to map calculation, it is also possible in phenix.refine to
    refine the anomalous scattering of specific atoms, which may be more
    accurate than using the non-anomalous **scattering factors.**

**B-factors** or **Atomic Displacement Parameters (ADPs)**: B-factors or ADPs
describe the variability or uncertainty in atomic positions, and (unlike
**occupancy**) have a resolution-dependent effect on the diffraction amplitude.
The simplest
model for these (**isotropic**) is a sphere centered around the atomic position,
but at high resolution (approximately 1.5A or better) it becomes possible to
model them as ellipsoids (**anisotropic**).  At low resolution (worse than
3-3.5A) it may be necessary to refine ADPs for small groups such as entire
residues, instead of individual atoms.  The total ADPs will also include
contribution from larger displacements such as those modeled by TLS
refinement and an overall anisotropic ADP for the entire crystal.  (Note that
in other contexts, "ADP" may instead mean "anisotropic displacement parameter".)

**Bijvoet mates**: F+ and F-, which are related by **Friedel's law**, except to
the extent that **anomalous scattering** is present.  Also sometimes called
"Friedel pairs".

**Bulk-solvent correction**: Scaling of low-resolution model-based amplitudes,
F(calc), to account for the effects of unmodelled disordered solvent in the
crystal.  Because the bulk solvent comprises such a large scattering mass in
macromolecular crystals, and the low-resolution reflections tend to dominate
the R-factor calculations, the correction step significantly decreases the
R-factors and is an essential step during refinement and map calculation.

**Clashscore**: a validation statistic used in the `Molprobity web server
<http://molprobity.biochem.duke.edu>`_ and the related `validation tools
<validation.htm>`_ in Phenix (on the command line, the program
``phenix.clashscore`` can also be used).  It is equal to the number of severe
atomic clashes (overlaps greater than 0.4A) per 1000 atoms.  A well-refined
structure should have a clashscore below 20; clashscores of zero are
exceptionally uncommon and very difficult to obtain.  Note that while the
VDW restraints used in refinement will help prevent the clashscore from
increasing, many severe clashses will require manual rebuilding to fix.

**Constraints**: In refinement, constraints force specific parameters to be
refined together.  Examples of this include rigid-body refinement (atomic
coordinates constrained), "riding" hydrogen atoms, or grouped ADPs.  Since
constraints reduce the number of refined parameters, they are particularly
useful at low resolution. See also **restraints**.

**Crystallographic Information Format (CIF)**: a type of structured file
format developed specifically for crystallography.  Although CIF files may be
used to represent any type of data, they are most commonly used in Phenix to
define **geometry restraints**, which are generated primarily by `eLBOW
<elbow_gui.htm>`_.  They are also used by the PDB (in a subset
of the format called "mmCIF") to store reflection data; these files may be
read directly by most programs in Phenix, or converted to MTZ format.

**Density modification**: A statistically-based method of phase improvement by
real-space manipulation of electron density, which dramatically improves
experimentally phased maps.  For SAD phasing, density modification is essential
to resolve phase ambiguity and obtain an interpretable map, but it is also
very helpful for other methods.

**Direct methods**: a phasing method based on mathematical relationships
between reflections, which does not require any additional information beyond
the diffracted amplitudes.  Direct methods are standard for small-molecule
crystallography, but because they require atomic-resolution data and only work
for relatively small structures (typically 1000 atoms or less), they are rarely
able to phase protein crystal data.  However, they can be used to locate heavy
atom sites if anomalous data of sufficient quality are available; in Phenix,
the program HySS uses direct methods to perform the heavy-atom search.
Herbert Hauptman and Jerome Karle won the `Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1985
<http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1985/>`_ for their
discovery of direct methods.

**Figure of Merit (FOM)**: An approximate measure of phase quality, calculated
for each reflection.  Scale is from 0 to 1, higher being better.  Although it
is sometimes reported in the context of refinement and density modification,
it is only useful for evaluating initial experimental phases.  A good MAD
solution will typically have an FOM greater than 0.4, while a SAD solution
should usually be greater than 0.3.

**Friedel's law**: a phenomenon in which each reflection (h,k,l) and its
mirror-image across the origin have identical amplitudes (but inverse phase).
Anomalous scattering breaks this symmetry, which can be taken advantage of to
locate heavy-atom sites and phase the structure.

**Hendrickson-Lattman coefficients**: Phase probability values, calculated
either experimentally based on heavy-atom methods (SAD, MAD, etc.) or directly
from the model, used in density modification and (if experimentally obtained)
as additional restraints during refinement.  Consists of four coefficients per
reflection, which describe a bimodal phase distribution.  (If calculated from
a model, the distribution will in fact be unimodal, but the same representation
is used by convention.)

**Insertion code**: a single column in the ATOM records of a PDB file, used to
supplement the residue number.  Insertion codes are used when a specific
numbering convention is desired, e.g. to preserve the identity of key residues
in related proteins, or to reflect an expressed sequence modified from the
genomic equivalent.  In these cases, consecutive residues might be numbered
25, 26, 26A, 26B, 26C, 27, etc.  When defining atom selections in Phenix,
the syntax "``icode A``" is used; the insertion code can also be combined with
the residue number to uniquely identify a residue, using the syntax
"``resid 26A``".

**Isomorphous replacement**: an older method for phasing protein
crystal structures, in which a native dataset is collected, followed by one
or more heavy-atom derivatives which are isomorphous to the native data, and
the differences in amplitudes are used to locate the heavy-atom substructure
and calculate experimental phases.  For many years isomorphous replacement
was the standard tool for phasing, but it is very time-consuming compared to
SAD or MAD, let alone molecular replacement, and is rarely used now except
for very difficult structures.  Several variants exist: SIR (single
isomorphous replacement), which like **SAD** requires density modification to
resolve the phase ambiguity; MIR (multiple isomorphous replacement); and
SIRAS or MIRAS, in which the anomalous signal of the heavy atoms is also
employed.  In Phenix, isomorphous replacement is performed by the `AutoSol
<autosol_gui.htm>`_ wizard.

**Isotropic**: moving equally in all directions.  In crystallography, this
is usually used to describe the simplest (and most common) parameterization of
B-factors or atomic displacement parameters (ADPs).  Only one parameter per
atom is refined, the
mean atomic displacement **u** (where B = 8 * pi^2 * u^2).  Visually, the
B-factor is represented as a sphere.  See also **anisotropic** and **TLS**.

**Kicked map**: A faster alternative to omit maps.  All coordinates are
shaken randomly by a small amount, and the map recalculated; this is done
repeatedly and the maps averaged.  This can help remove bias and in some cases
noise as well.  Available in both `phenix.refine <refine_gui.htm>`_ and
`phenix.maps <create_maps.htm>`_.

**Least squares**: an older refinement methodology, no longer in widespread
use for macromolecular crystallography.  A least-squares target assumes that
the error in experimental observations takes a Gaussian distribution; modern
maximum-likelihood targets do a better job weighting the observations and
accounting for sources of error.  (The optimization methods used, such as
minimization or simulated annealing, are the same regardless of the specific
target.)  In Phenix, a least-squares target is still used when performing
twinned refinement, or refinement against a very small number of reflections.

**Log-likelihood gain (LLG)**: a statistical measure used by Phaser; in the
context of molecular replacement, it essentially scores the model placement
in comparison to a random model.  The LLG should be positive and relatively
large if the MR solution is correct.

**Map coefficients**: This is simply the Fourier coefficients for an
electron density map, in MTZ format.  Graphics programs such as Coot (and
PHENIX, internally) will perform the Fourier transform automatically to obtain
the real-space density.  Most programs in PHENIX output map coefficients
rather than pre-calculated maps, but the terms are often used interchangeably.

**Maximum likelihood**: The statistical methodology used in target functions
for refinement and phasing, in which the probability of the model given the
data is maximized.  Maximum likelihood is much better at weighting the data
appropriately than the previously used least-squares method, and leads to
greater sensitivity and improved maps.  See `McCoy Acta Cryst. (2004). D60,
2169-2183 <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15572770>`_ for an introduction
to the method as used in crystallography.

**Miller array**: Any set of data indexed by ``h,k,l`` ("Miller indices").
This can include experimental intensities or amplitudes, phases, weights
(such as FOM), Hendrickson-Lattman coefficients, R-free flags, etc.  These are
the basic unit of reflection data in PHENIX, and may combine multiple columns
from the input file (for instance, F and SIGF in an MTZ file will be grouped
into a single Miller array containing both amplitudes and sigmas).

**MIR**: see **Isomorphous replacement**.

**Molecular replacement (MR)**: the most popular phasing method, accounting
for more than three-quarters of all new structures.  MR uses known structures
to phase (and also provide an initial model for refinement), by determining
their rotation and translation in the unit cell of the collected data.  Unlike
phasing methods (SAD, MAD, MIR, etc.), MR does not require special experimental
setup or especially high-quality data.  The search model may either be a single
PDB file, an ensemble of superimposed PDB files of similar structure, or a
processed electron density map (containing only the region of interest).  The
search model is often nearly identical to the target structure (e.g. when the
goal is a known protein in complex with a ligand, or a point mutant), but
search models with sequence identities as low as 40% are usually still easily
solved, and significantly lower-identity models may still be used with
additional processing if their structures are similar enough.  In Phenix, MR
is performed by `Phaser <phaser_mr.htm>`_ and various derivatives.

**Non-crystallographic symmetry (NCS)**: Symmetry within a crystal that is
independent of the lattice type; this is very common in biomolecules,
especially homo-oligomeric proteins.  Information about NCS can be used during
density modification, and as additional restraints on the conformation of
related groups during refinement.  (PHENIX does not currently support NCS
constraints, which force related molecules to be identical.)

**Occupancy**: an attribute of atoms in a structure, equal to the fraction of
unit cells in which the atom occurs in the given position.  High-resolution
structures (usually 1.6A or better) will often need occupancy refinement for
sidechains which occur in more than one conformation, or for ligands which
are not 100% bound.  The occupancy should never be set to zero in a deposited
structure.  Note that B-factor and occupancy are correlated in practice and
the effects of each may be difficult to tell apart; however, partial occupancy
has an equal effect at any resolution, unlike B-factors whose effect is
resolution-dependent.

**Omit map**: a map generated by deleting part of the structure (for instance,
a bound ligand) and recalculating phases and F(calc).  This almost always
involves simple refinement of the modified structure to remove phase bias, and
simulated annealing is recommended for best results.  A variant, the
**composite omit map**, stitches together the contribution of many individual
omit maps, which collectively omit all atoms.  In PHENIX, these may be
calculated using the `AutoBuild <autobuild.htm>`_ wizard.  See also the entry
for "kicked map".

**Overfitting**: Optimization of R-work at the expense of other quality
metrics, especially R-free.  The most obvious indication of overfitting is
divergence of R-work and R-free, which ideally should decrease in sync
throughout refinement.  In most cases, the solution is to add or tighten
restraints, or reduce the number of refined parameters.

**Ramachandran plot**: a two-dimensional graph of the phi,psi angle
combinations of their allowed backbone; also refers to the expected/allowed
distribution of points on this graph.  This distribution is dictated by
steric constraints on the backbone conformation, originally identified by
`Ramachandran et al. (1963) J Mol Biol 7:95-99
<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/13990617>`_.  Because the Ramachandran
plot is an essential validation metric, phi and psi are typically left
unrestrained during refinement.  In the `Molprobity server
<http://molprobity.biochem.duke.edu>`_ and the Phenix validation tools, the
plot is divided into "favored", "allowed", and "outlier" regions; a
well-refined structure should have 98% of residues favored, and less than 0.2%
outliers, although at lower resolutions it may be difficult to obtain these
statistics.  Note that the expected distribution varies depending on residue
type and environment; in the current version of Phenix, six different
distributions are used.

contours define the borders of the favored and allowed regions.*

**Restraints**: In refinement, restraints keep specific independent parameters
from diverging too far.  At most resolutions, basic geometry restraints
(bonds, bond angles, dihedral angles, chiral centers, planar groups, and
VDW interactions) and ADP similarity restraints will be used, usually taking
the form of a simple harmonic potential.  Depending on
the specific structure and data, additional restraints may include experimental
phase distributions (see **Hendrickson-Lattman coefficients**) or restraints
between related molecules (**NCS** or a reference structure).  Restraints do
not reduce the number of refined parameters, but are essential to maintain
proper geometry and prevent overfitting.  However, they become less necessary
as resolution increases, and restraining a high-resolution model too tightly
will actually make it worse.  See also **constraints**.

**R-factor**: Crystallographic residual, equal to sum(abs(Fobs)-abs(Fcalc)) /
sum(abs(Fobs)).
R-merge, R-sym, etc. are calculated similarly using redundant observations
instead of Fc.  Generating Fc at random will typically result in an R-factor
of 0.55, which is therefore the threshold for determining if a model is placed
correctly.  (Note that in practice, molecular replacement solutions often have
higher starting R-factors, but these will rapidly drop during refinement if
the solution is correct.)

**R-free**: R-factor calculated from reflections not used in refinement,
typically 5-10% of the data (in statistical terminology this is called
"cross-validation").  If the refinement was parameterized appropriately,
the R-free should be reduced along with the R-factor the "working" set (R-work),
although it will always be a higher value.  An increase in R-free indicates
an incorrect optimization, even if R-work decreases.  A large spread between
R-work and R-free is a primary symptom of overfitting.  See `Brunger AT (1992)
Nature 355:472-475 <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18481394>`_ for
full rationale.

**Rotamer**: A well-defined unique combination of dihedral angle values in
a group of atoms; the term is almost always used in reference to amino acid
sidechains, although RNA backbone angles are also rotameric.  The sidechain
rotamers used in Phenix are extracted from a set of
high-quality, high-resolution structures (the Top500 database).  The vast
majority of sidechains in a finished structure should be recognizably
rotameric unless the density very clearly supports an outlier conformation.
Because the standard geometry restraints and minimization methods often do a
poor job moving sidechains into rotameric positions, a separate rotamer-
fitting step is available in ``phenix.refine``.

**Rotation function (RF)**: the first part of molecular replacement, which
establishes the rotational orientation of the search model in the crystal.
This is independent of the exact space group, e.g. the same rotation will
be correct whether the space group is P6(2) or P6(4).  The rotation function
is typically very fast in Phaser, but the resulting **Z-score** is almost
never useful for determining whether the rotation is correct or not.

**Scattering factors**: the numbers describing the scattering of X-rays by
a given atom type (usually its electrons).  These are used in refinement to
calculate the
expected electron density and structure factors given a set of atomic
parameters (XYZ coordinates, B-factor, occupancy, and alternately, anomalous
scattering).  A variety of parameterizations of scattering factors are
available in Phenix, but the most commonly used (for X-ray refinement) is
called "n_gaussian".  Scattering factors for neutron diffraction experiments
(where the nucleus, rather than the electrons, is responsible for the
scattering) are also available.

**Sigma-A weighting**: a method of weighting difference map coefficients to
more accurately account for errors in the model.  This is standard practice
in macromolecular crystallography, as it leads to improved maps.  A sigma-A
weighted map will typically described as "2mFo-DFc" or "mFo-DFc", with the "D"
being the relevant value ("m" is the **Figure of Merit** for each reflection).
The maximum likelihood target in Phaser is a derivation of this methodology.
See Read, R.J.: Acta Cryst. A42 (1986) 140-149 for original derivation.

**Simulated annealing**: An optimization method which heats up a system and
allows it to slowly cool, as a way of escaping local energy minima where
simple gradient-based minimization fails.  In crystallography, this means
running a simple molecular dynamics simulation starting at very high
temperatures (~2500 K), with the agreement with X-ray data included as an
additional pseudo-energy term.  Especially useful for poorly built structures
early in refinement, and as a method to remove phase bias (e.g. for omit maps).
In PHENIX, both Cartesian and torsion-angle dynamics are available; the latter
is intended for low-resolution refinement as it uses fewer parameters.

**Single-wavelength anomalous diffraction (SAD)**: probably the most popular
experimental phasing method currently in use, SAD requires only a single
wavelength from one crystal.  The experimental phases themselves will be of
poor quality because the SAD experiment cannot resolve the phase ambiguity,
but density modification will lead to a significantly improved map in most
cases.  SAD is often performed with selenomethionine-incorporated protein,
but any anomalously scattering atom (including sulfur, if the data are of
very high quality) may be used.  In Phenix, SAD may be performed by either
the `AutoSol wizard <autosol_gui.htm>`_ or `Phaser-EP <phaser_ep.htm>`_,
although the latter only calculates initial phases and completes the heavy-atom
substructure, whereas AutoSol will also perform initial heavy-atom location,
density modification, and preliminary model-building.

**Skew**: Statistic derived from the distribution of electron density values
in an experimentally phased map.  The skew describes the deviation from a
Gaussian distribution; a correct map will have a slight skew towards higher
values.  A skew above 0.2 is usually indicative of successful phasing.

**SMILES string**: a simple textual representation of molecular structure,
originally developed by `Daylight Chemical Information Systems
<http://www.daylight.com>`_ and now in wide
use by the chemistry community.  Although SMILES strings do not encode
coordinates, unlike PDB files they uniquely encode the connectivity of
molecules, and can optionally even specify chirality.  They are therefore one
of the prefered input formats for eLBOW.  As an example, the SMILES string for
benzene is ``c1ccccc1``.

**Translation function (TF)**: the second step of molecular replacement, which
starts from the output of the **rotation function** and determines the exact
position of the search model within the unit cell.  The TF is significantly
more time-consuming than the RF, but it can resolve space-group ambiguity, and
the resulting Z-score (TFZ), in combination with the **LLG**, will usually be
sufficient to determine whether the solution is correct or not.

**Translational pseudo-symmetry (TNCS)**: a common crystal pathology in which
the unit cell size is effectively doubled due to a near-symmetric translation
operator which breaks higher symmetry.  The effect of this on data is to double
the number of reflections, with the additional reflections systematically
weaker.  TNCS can be detected by this signature, and by the presence of a large
off-origin peak in the Patterson map; `Xtriage <xtriage_gui.htm>`_ is used in
Phenix for this purpose.  Although not as severe as twinning, TNCS
can cause problems during phasing and (to a lesser extend) refinement, because
it breaks some of the assumptions used in the maximum-likelihood equations used
in Phenix.  This is now handled by Phaser for molecular replacement and SAD
phasing.  See `Zwart et al. (2008) Acta Cryst D. 64:99-107
<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18094473>`_ for more information.

**Turn, Libration, and Screw (TLS)**: A way of describing anisotropic motion
for rigid groups of atoms which move collectively in the crystal.  These are
usually separate chains, or domains in a flexible protein, but there is no
restriction on the size of groups.  Refining TLS parameters will result in
all atoms that are part of a TLS group being treated as anisotropic - in this
sense, it is essentially constrained anisotropic refinement.  Because it
only adds ten parameters per group, TLS refinement is suitable for almost any
resolution.

**Twinning**: a common crystal pathology in which different regions of the
crystal assume different orientations.  In the simplest case, epitaxial
twinning, this is simply two or more crystals stacked together, without
superimposed lattices, and the result is multiple distinct lattices visible in
the diffraction pattern, which can often be handled by data processing
programs.  Merohedral twinning preserves the overall lattice symmetry, so
that the diffraction spots contain the contribution of two or more "twin
domains" which cannot easily be disambiguated.  Small twin fractions (perhaps
10% or less) are not usually problematic and can easily be overlooked.
Larger fractions, up to 50% ("perfect twinning"), can make experimental
phasing very difficult, and result in abnormally high R-factors and poor map
quality during refinement.  This can be handled by refining with a twin law,
although this needs to be performed with caution.  Twinning is usually
easily detected by the systematic deviation from expected intensity statistics;
in Phenix, `Xtriage <xtriage_gui.htm>`_ is the program used to diagnose and
analyze possible twinning.  See `Zwart et al. (2008) Acta Cryst D. 64:99-107
<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18094473>`_ for more information.

**Wilson plot**: a plot showing the average intensity value for each
resolution bin (typically using a relatively large number of bins, e.g. 30).
Among other things, the Wilson plot shows the falloff of intensity with
resolution due to the B-factors of the atoms, and can be used to determine an
approximate overall B-factor for the data.  Because of the non-random
distribution of atoms in the unit cell, the Wilson plot has a distinctive
appearance, especially for protein and nucleic acid structures, and deviations
from the expected plot may indicate data pathologies.
