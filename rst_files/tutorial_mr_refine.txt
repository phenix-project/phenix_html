Overview
--------

This tutorial is intended for users who are completely unfamiliar with
macromolecular crystallography and/or Phenix.  It outlines the procedure for
solving a structure by molecular replacement, performing initial refinement,
and rebuilding the structure in Coot.  Because the structure involved
(Ran-GDP R76E mutant) is relatively small and moderate resolution, it can be
significantly improved in a reasonable amount of time without much difficulty.
You should first read the documentation for the `Phenix GUI <phenix_gui.htm>`_
before running this tutorial.

As with other Phenix tutorial datasets, you can automatically set up a project
with the necessary files from the GUI; the example will be listed in the
"Molecular replacement" category of the example menu.

There will be three input files for this project: the experimental data and
R-free flags (MTZ format), the wild-type RanGDP used as a search model for
MR (PDB format), and the sequence (FASTA format).

Step 0: Xtriage
---------------

This step is not strictly necessary to solve the structure, but is strongly
recommended for any dataset that you are unfamiliar with, especially if you
are unsure whether and/or how the structure can be solved.  Launch `Xtriage
<xtriage_gui.htm>`_ by clicking the icon under "Reflection tools" in the main
GUI.  Only the MTZ and FASTA files are used as input for this example (the
"Reference PDB file" option only applies for models which have already been
placed correctly and refined agains the data).

  .. image:: images/rangdp_xtriage.png

Once you have entered the files, click the Run button to start Xtriage.  The
program should finish in a few seconds.  Take some time to look through the
result tabs and familiarize yourself with the statistics reported here.  Since
this is high-quality data, there is nothing that requires special handling.
(We usually recommend using the original intensities - ideally unmerged - for
Xtriage, but since only amplitudes are available for this dataset those can
be used instead.)  Note that based on the sequence, Xtriage has (correctly)
suggested that only one copy is present in the asymmetric unit (ASU) of the
crystal.

Step 1: Phaser-MR
-----------------

To solve the structure we will use the simple `Phaser-MR <phaser_mr.htm>`_ GUI,
which should be the first program in the "Molecular replacement" category.
This interface is suitable for structures where we only need to use a single
search model.  All three files (MTZ, PDB, and FASTA) should be used as input.
(The sequence is optional; we could instead enter the expected molecular weight
or let Phaser guess based on the ensemble, but it is safer and simpler to
supply detailed information.)

  .. image:: images/rangdp_phaser_config.png

In the "Sequence identity" field, enter "99" (the search model differs in
sequence by only a single residue, although some local conformational
differences exist.)  All other settings can be left on default for this run.
Again, click "Run" to start Phaser; this should take several minutes.  You
can watch the status window to see how molecular replacement is proceeding;
we recommend familiarizing yourself with the log output.

  .. image:: images/rangdp_phaser_run.png

Phaser will open a new tab displaying the results when the job is finished.
There are several obvious clues that model placement and phasing was
successful:

  - The **LLG (log-likelihood gain)** is high and positive.  This is essentially
    a measure of the probability of the solution.  (Negative scores almost
    always mean that MR was not successful.)

  - The **TFZ (translation function Z-score)** is well above 8 (the threshold
    above which the large majority of solutions are correct).  This indicates
    the signal-to-noise ratio of the solution.

  - Although not displayed in this tab, the **R-factor** after refinement is
    well below the threshold for a random agreement between F-obs and F-calc.
    You can find this in the log output on the status tab if you scroll up
    (look for "RVAL" in the section labeled "Refinement table").  Note that a
    higher-than-random R-factor cannot be taken as an indicator that MR failed,
    since correct solutions will very often have this property (but immediately
    improve upon running full refinement).


  .. image:: images/rangdp_phaser_result.png

At this time you can click "Open in Coot" to view the model and maps calculated
by Phaser.  However, the map quality will be poor at this stage, so it is not
worth making any changes to the model until after refinement.

Step 2: Refinement
------------------

You can launch `phenix.refine <refine_gui.htm>`_ directly from Phaser by
clicking the button labeled "Run phenix.refine".  This will load the output
model and the MTZ file;
you should also input the sequence (this is not actually used in refinement,
but the post-refinement validation will check for sequence errors in the model).

  .. image:: images/rangdp_refine_config.png

The appropriate column labels and symmetry information should be loaded for
you automatically.  You should look at the options on the "Refinement settings"
tab to get an idea of what is possible in phenix.refine; however, for this
structure the default settings will be fine.

Once refinement is started, a new tab will be added with two sub-tabs for
log output and overall status.  You should familiarize yourself with the log
output, especially as it provides some insight into how refinement is
performed in Phenix, but for routine use the graphical view is sufficient.

  .. image:: images/rangdp_refine_log.png

If you are running Phenix with default settings and have Coot installed, the
GUI will start Coot with the current model and maps continuously updated.  (You
can disable this in the Refinement settings of the preferences.)
The R-factors should start to improve immediately upon refinement; both R-work
and R-free will drop significantly.  (Note that R-free is initially lower than
R-work because the structure was not previously refined against this dataset;
this is quite common for structures solved by MR.)  The geometry should also
improve slightly.  By the third cycle there is less improvement being made and
the R-free will converge near 0.29; the structure could probably benefit from
a couple more cycles but it is clear that manual intervention will be needed,
and the maps should be much better now.

  .. image:: images/rangdp_refine_status.png

After refinement several more tabs will appear displaying a summary of the
results plus a number of validation metrics.  A list of output files is shown
on the first of these tabs, along with buttons to start Coot or PyMOL.  You
should now click the Coot button to view the final refined model and maps.

Step 3: Rebuilding
------------------

Step 4: More refinement
-----------------------

Variations
----------

There are several other ways you can use this dataset to learn about Phenix:

  - **Advanced Phaser**: you can use the full Phaser-MR GUI instead of the
    simple one; this is the GUI you would need if the structure contained
    multiple different components and/or you needed more control over how the
    search is performed. (Time: several minutes)

  - **Ligand fitting**: instead of resetting the occupancy for GDP and MG, you
    could instead delete these residues and run `LigandFit <ligandfit_gui.htm>`_
    to place GDP in the difference map. (Time: approx. 10 minutes, less if
    multiple processors are available.)

  - **AutoBuild**: you can let Phenix rebuild the structure for you in
    `AutoBuild <autobuild_gui.htm>`_.  Try setting the "rebuild in place"
    both ways; True or Auto will move the existing atoms without adding or
    removing any, False will build an entirely new model.  (Time: several
    hours, depending on number of processors.)

  - **Advanced refinement**: try experimenting with the settings in
    `phenix.refine <refine_gui.htm>`_ to get a feel for how these affect
    refinement.  Simulated annealing may be particularly interesting.  (Time:
    several minutes to ~1 hour, depending on options and number of processors.)
