Guided Ligand Replacement
=========================

Overview
--------

The Guided Ligand Replacement (GLR) tool is designed to use prior
knowledge from a previously fit ligand to expedite the fitting of a
"similar" ligand into the same or "similar" protein. The similarity
required between the pair of ligands can be as little as a few atoms.

The proteins are overlayed using ``phenix.superpose_pdbs``. The ligands
are matched using the electronic Ligand Builder and Optimization
Workbench (eLBOW) via another tool called ``phenix.superpose_ligands``.
Once the ligand has been fit, a Real-Space Refinement (RSR) is
performed and the final model written to disk.

Input files
-----------

GLR requires a number of inputs and also has some options, all of which
are provided using the ``phil`` formalism. The list of
required inputs:

  - **guide_pdb_file_name**: this is a PDB file containing a model-ligand
    model.

  - **protein_pdb_file_name**: this is a file containing the protein
    model of current interest into which the ligand is to be fit.

  - **map_coeffs_file_name**: this is a maps coefficients file output from
    a ``phenix.refine`` run.

The input for the ligand can be any input file that is readable by eLBOW.
Either or both of the following phil parameters can be used.

  - **ligand_input_file_name**: this is a file containing chemical information
    about the ligand.

  - **ligand_cif_file_name**: this is the
    of a ligand restraints file for the RSR step. If not supplied, the
    restraints are generated from **ligand_input_file_name**.

  - **ligand_code**: the ligand code from the PDB Chemical Components so that
    restraints and geometry can be generated.

Optional inputs include:

  - **ligand_selection_in_guide_model**: this selects a ligand in the guiding
    model. While GLR tries to make a sensible selection based on ligand code
    or uniqueness, it may be necessary to make an explicit selection.

  - **replace_ligand_in_guide_pdb_file_name**: replace the ligand in the
    guiding protein model with the input ligand. Useful for 'repairing'
    ligands.

  - **phenix.superpose_pdbs**: this allows selection of the same parameters
    as in the standalone program.

Output files
------------

By default, GLR will generate a PDB file with the fit ligand.
