Guided Ligand Replacement
=========================

Overview
--------

The Guided Ligand Replacement (GLR) tool is designed to use prior
knowledge from a previously fit ligand to expedite the fitting of a
"similar" ligand into the same or "similar" protein. The similarity
required between the pair of ligands can be as little as a few atoms.

The proteins are overlayed using ``phenix.superpose_pdbs``. The ligands
are matched using the electronic Ligand Builder and Optimization
Workbench (eLBOW) via another tool called ``phenix.superpose_ligands``. 
Once the ligand has been fit, a Real-Space Refinement (RSR) is
performed and the final model written to disk.

Input files
-----------

GLR requires a number of inputs and also has some options, all of which
are provided using the ``phil`` formalism. The list of
required inputs:

  - **guide_pdb_file_name**: this is a PDB file containing a model-ligand
    model.

  - **protein_pdb_file_name**: this is a file containing the protein
    model of current interest into which the ligand is to be fit.

  - **map_coeffs_file_name**: this is a maps coefficients file output from
    a ``phenix.refine`` run.

  - **Ligand file**: this is any input file that is readable by eLBOW and
    is added via the ``ligand_input_file_name`` phil parameter. There is
    also an optional parameter, ``ligand_cif_file_name``, for the addition
    of a ligand restraints file for the RSR step.

Optional inputs include:

  - **ligand_selection_in_guide_model**: this selects a ligand in the guiding
    model. While GLR tries to make a sensible selection based on ligand code
    or uniqueness, it may be necessary to make an explicit selection.

  - **phenix.superpose_pdbs**: this allows selection of the same parameters
    as in the standalone program.

Output files
------------

By default, GLR will generate a PDB file with the fit ligand.
