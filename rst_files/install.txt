============
Installation
============

PHENIX is supported on most common Linux platforms, Mac OS X version 10.4 or
newer, and Windows XP or newer.  Binary installers are built on Fedora Core 3
(intel-linux-2.6 and intel-linux-2.6-x86_64), Fedora Core 8
(intel-linux-2.6-x86_64), Mac OS 10.4.11 (mac-intel-osx), Mac OS 10.6.8
(mac-intel-osx-x86_64), Windows XP (intel-windows), and Windows 7
(intel-windows-x86_64).  Nightly tests of the underlying components are run on
additional systems.  In most cases the binary installers should run without
problems on other Linux distributions
such as Ubuntu or SuSE.  Kernels prior to 2.6 are not supported, but kernel
versions 3.x should be compatible with the installers built on 2.6.

If you are running Mac OS 10.6 (Snow Leopard) or newer, you will almost
certainly want to use the 64-bit Mac installer.  On Linux, you
can find out what platform you are running with the command 'uname -p';
for machines reporting "i686", use the intel-linux-2.6 installer.  On Windows,
the 64-bit Windows 7 installer only supports machines which actually run the
64-bit version of the OS; if you are using 32-bit Windows 7 (or previous) you
will need to use the 32-bit installer built on Windows XP.

see ``SOURCES``.

Space requirements
-------------------

For the complete PHENIX installation you will need approximately 2.5GB
of disk space.

Graphical installer (Mac and Windows)
-------------------------------------

Installation by this method uses familiar interfaces provided by the operating
systems.  In both cases the destination directory is fixed: on Windows this
will be the top level of the **C:** drive, on Mac it will be the folder
**/Applications**.  You will need administrative priviledges to run the
installers.

Command-line installer (Mac and Linux)
----------------------------------------

You should obtain the latest distribution of PHENIX including the
binary bundles for your machine architectures. Unpack the tar file::

  % tar xvf phenix-installer-<version>-<platform>.tar

Change to the installer directory::

  % cd phenix-installer-<version>

To install::

  % ./install       [will install in /usr/local/phenix-<version> by default,
                     requires root permissions]

  % ./install --prefix=<directory>  [will make <directory>/phenix-<version> and install there]

Note: ``<directory>`` must be a absolute path (i.e. starts with a /). A
relative path starting with ../ will not work correctly.

Installation of the binary version of PHENIX requires no compilation, only
the generation of some data files, so you will probably have to wait about
5-10 minutes for the installation to complete (depending on the performance of
your installation platform).
