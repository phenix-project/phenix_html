The phenix.xtriage graphical interface
======================================

Overview
========

The configuration of Xtriage is much simpler than most of the other programs
in the Phenix GUI; the minimum input is a reflection file and symmetry
information, which for MTZ files is automatically extracted.  Xtriage is also
run automatically by the wizards (AutoSol, AutoBuild, and AutoMR) and the
graphical results can be viewed from the GUIs for those programs as well.

To launch Xtriage, open the main Phenix GUI and click on or drag-and-drop a
reflection file onto the Xtriage module.  The command-line equivalent is
``phenix.xtriage_gui``; most parameters recognized by the command-line program
should work here as well.  The configuration window is minimal:



The output of the GUI is nearly identical in content to the output of the
command-line version.
