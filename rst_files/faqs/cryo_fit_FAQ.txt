cc values have kept decreased (or have not increased that much) during step 8
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Initial few steps of cryo_fit in step 8 may decrease cc values temporarily as an initial perturbation.
- However, if it keeps decreasing continuously (or do not increase that much), it may indicate two possible cases.

 - Case 1 <A user input pdb file has reasonable structural geometry> For this case, try below possible solutions. If cryo_fit still can't find better (higher) cc, then the initial correlation between user input pdb file and cryo-EM map is already high enough. Just run `phenix.real_space_refine <https://www.phenix-online.org/documentation/reference/real_space_refine.html>`__ only and deposit. Doo Nam recommends to argue/claim in a paper like "Our fit is so high, even cryo_fit did not find higher level of fit than our initial fit". This bold recommendation is based on his limited observations so far. Therefore, if you have a better cc model (from manual fit?) than cryo_fitted model, I would appreciate if you can email me (doonam.kim@gmail.com).


 - Case 2 <A  user input pdb file has unreasonable structural geometry> For this case, although the initial fit between user's atomic model and map looks good, it is a fictitious fitting without consideration of ideal atomistic model geometry. Run cryo_fit to find decent fit to the cryo-EM map that restores/maintains reasonable structural geometry based on molecular dynamics forcefield (amber03.ff).

- There are possible solutions

 1. Provide a higher resolution map (like better than 4.5 Angstrom) tends to find higher cc since there is a more chance of finding fittable regions.
 2. Cryo_fit calculates the gradient of cc. If cryo_fit is provided a giant cryo-em map with a tiny atomic model, then there is a large empty space (not filled). Therefore, the constraint forces for the model are very small. Consequently, these small forces are not helpful.

  2-1. Re-run cryo_fit with an atomic model that fits the majority of the map. If you fit multiple atomic models into a symmetric map or do sequential fitting into a non-symmetric map, watch `Tom Goddard's lecture (2013) <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VGYo1pRRZ8&t=0s&list=PLVetO1F9gm_oa--j37yrjzJ4yVJYzPVN5&index=12>`__

  2-2. Re-run cryo_fit with only a relevant map region. See 'How to extract a relevant map region?' in this FAQ.

 3. If the initial model is not properly aligned to a map, see 'How to improve initial cc?' in this FAQ.

 4. A user may enforce a stronger initial map weight (e.g. emweight_multiply_by) manually. However, since cryo_fit automatically increases emweight_multiply_by if it doesn't find higher cc anyway, manual increase in map weight may not necessarily find higher cc.



How can I provide gaussian filtered maps?
----------------------------------------------------
- See 'How can I provide gaussian filtered maps?' in `cryo_fit2_FAQ <cryo_fit2_FAQ.html>`__



How can I use double digit/character chain ID pdb file?
---------------------------------------------------------
- For a large molecule (like ribosome), it is typical to put a prefix to chain ID so that the ID is double digits/characters. Since gromacs cannot deal with this, cryo_fit automatically removes the prefix.

- If a user sees an error with single chain ID for `phenix.real_space_refine <https://www.phenix-online.org/documentation/reference/real_space_refine.html>`__, Doo Nam recommends to use

 - python <User Phenix>/modules/cryo_fit/files_for_steps/9_after_cryo_fit/solve_duplicate_atoms_issue/add_all_prefix.py

How to draw a figure with cc values?
----------------------------------------------
- python <phenix_path>/modules/cryo_fit/files_for_steps/9_after_cryo_fit/draw_cc/draw_cc.py cc_record

 - If a user is using ssh linked linux, run 'set DISPLAY' to avoid the message of "Unable to access the X Display, is $DISPLAY set properly?".

- PHENIX GUI for cryo_fit shows this figure automatically.



How to enlarge map box size?
--------------------------------------------------------
- One can know map size by

 1. cryo_fit which reports a map size between step 6 and step 7 with codes of
 
  - from iotbx import ccp4_map
  
  - ccp4_map = ccp4_map.map_reader(user_input_map)
  
  - target_map_data = ccp4_map.map_data()


 2. EMAN2's `e2iminfo <http://molecularart.dk/2015/11/cryo-em-how-to-change-box-size-and-pixel-size/>`__

  - For example, e2iminfo.py <user>.mrc

  - (note) As of EMAN2.2, the file extension should be mrc, not ccp4

 3. VMD which can visualize current map size as in this FAQ.


- Then, `relion_image_handler <http://molecularart.dk/2015/11/cryo-em-how-to-change-box-size-and-pixel-size/>`__ can enlarge map box size.

 - For example, relion_image_handler --i <user>.mrc --new_box 370 --o <user_box_size_370>.mrc


How to extract a relevant map region?

- See 'How to extract a relevant map region?' in `cryo_fit2_FAQ <cryo_fit2_FAQ.html>`__


How to generate and record movie?
---------------------------------------
- See `Generate_record_movie_by_cryo_fit1 <../tutorials/cryo_fit_movie.html>`__


How to improve initial cc?
---------------------------------------
- See 'How to improve initial cc?' in `cryo_fit2_FAQ <cryo_fit2_FAQ.html>`__


How to maximize cc?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Generally, as seen in `Cryo_fit: Democratization of flexible fitting for cryo-EM, 2019 <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1047847719301285?via%3Dihub>`__, cryo_fit1 which is followed by `phenix.real_space_refine <https://www.phenix-online.org/documentation/reference/real_space_refine.html>`__ tends to maximize cc.

- However, if there is a room/chance to idealize secondary structure further even after cryo_fit1, then cryo_fit1 + `phenix.model_idealization <https://www.phenix-online.org/documentation/reference/model_idealization.html>`__ + `phenix.real_space_refine <https://www.phenix-online.org/documentation/reference/real_space_refine.html>`__ combination resulted in the maximum cc.

- When the fitting needs to pass through a local minimum energetically for a perferct fit (half of the molecule is already fitted, the other half is not fitted), running `phenix.dock_in_map <https://www.phenix-online.org/documentation/reference/dock_in_map.html>`__ before cryo_fit1 is recommended.

 - Note that these options do rigid-body fitting only. Therefore, it is useful for global fitting before cryo_fit2. When overall orientation is	already	well fitted, these often are not that useful for cryo_fit1.

- When the fitting protein molecule to a map requires a significant conformational change, enforcing stronger emweight_multiply_by tends to fit better (obviously).

  - For example, phenix.cryo_fit <user.pdb> <user.map> emweight_multiply_by=50

  - At this high emweight_multiply_by, the secondary structures may be broken (slightly or seriously) right after cryo_fit running.

  - However, `phenix.model_idealization <https://www.phenix-online.org/documentation/reference/model_idealization.html>`__ which is followed by `phenix.real_space_refine <https://www.phenix-online.org/documentation/reference/real_space_refine.html>`__ perfectly restored ideal secondary structures and fitted very well.



I can't run phenix.superpose_pdbs with cryo_fitted pdb file
-----------------------------------------------------------------
- phenix.superpose_pdbs can superimpose only between pdb files that have equally/similarly aligned nucleic names. 

 - This applies to all pdb input files (not only cryo_fitted files). 

- Therefore, consider to align both input files by "python <PHENIX path>/modules/cryo_fit/steps/9_after_cryo_fit/align_nucleic_acid_name_into_middle/align_nucleic_acid_name_into_middle.py"



I see "Fatal error: A charge group moved too far between two domain decomposition steps. This usually means that your system is not well equilibrated" at my 8_cryo_fit step.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Using macOS 10.13.6 helped rather than using Ubuntu 16.04. Maybe macOS has better numerical stability.
- One gromacs expert suggested to try smaller time_step_for_cryo_fit. 
- However for Doo Nam, simply using macOS solved the problem.
- Less likely, but still a possible reason is that the map weight is too high. Therefore, lowering emweight_multiply_by may help.


I see "Fatal error: Incomplete ring in HIS50" at my 8_cryo_fit step
------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Doo Nam observed this error when he tried to run cryo_fit with 3jch.pdb that has incomplete Histidine ring atoms.
- He solved with UCSF Chimera

 1. Open pdb file
 2. [menu]
 3. Select -> Residue -> HIS
 4. Tools -> Structure Editing -> Rotamers -> OK
 5. (select the most probable rotamer each)
 6. File -> Save PDB

- Pymol and Swisspdb viewer have similar residue fixing functions
- Alternatively, a user may identify residues manually by running <phenix-xxxx>/modules/cryo_fit/steps/0_prepare_cryo_fit/count_number_of_atoms_in_each_residue/



I see "Fatal error: Number of grid cells is zero. Probably the system and box collapsed." at my 8_cryo_fit step.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- step_8 may be full of stepxb_nx.pdb.

 - Most likely, this means that initial cc is too low for MD simulation.

  - When Doo Nam ran `phenix.real_space_refine <https://www.phenix-online.org/documentation/reference/real_space_refine.html>`__ first, then run real_space_refined atomic model in cryo_fit, it was solved.

  - Alternatively, improve initial cc by fitting initial atomic model into a map (see "How to improve initial cc?" in this FAQ)

 - Less likely, but still a possible case is when the map weight is too high, lowering emweight_multiply_by may help.



I see "pdb file cleaning is not done" at my step 1 (Make gro and topology file by regular gromacs)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"I edited out lipids, HEM and other hetero atoms and I verified that they are all gone. However, still my pdb file is not clean enough for gromacs_cryo_fit".

- If a user's lipids, HEM and other hetero atoms are not necessary for now, a user may remove (take out). A user may add those atoms after flexible fit (cryo_fit). Please send Doo Nam (doonam.kim@gmail.com) a user's pdb input file only (no map). He will take a look. gromacs version that cryo_fit uses has amber03 forcefield which may not have needed parameters for user's less-usual atoms/residues.

- If a user's lipids, HEM and other hetero atoms are necessary during flexible fitting, Doo Nam recommends to use `cryo_fit2 <https://phenix-online.org/documentation/reference/cryo_fit2.html>`__ since it supports phenix.eLBOW derived ligand parameters.



I see "Software inconsistency error" at my 8_cryo_fit step
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Doo Nam could not find useful solution for this "Software inconsistency error: Inconsistent DD boundary staggering limits!" message at http://www.gromacs.org/Documentation/Errors.

- He observed this message for 2 cases.

 1. When he tried to run cryo_fit on Ubuntu 16.0. However, the same data set (map and model) didn't cause any error on his macOS 10.13.6.

 2. When he tried to fit a very lowly correlated initial atomistic model to a map (therefore, he observed like step 3600 correlation coefficient: -0.000820). Therefore, he ran `phenix.dock_in_map <https://www.phenix-online.org/documentation/reference/dock_in_map.html>`__ first then, provided placed_model.pdb as the input model to cryo_fit. Then, the error disappeared.


I see "state.cpt not found, step_8 may be full of stepxb_nx.pdb" at my 8_cryo_fit step
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Literally, steps/8_cryo_fit fold may be full of stepxb_nx.pdb files.

 - Most likely, this means that a cryo_fit input pdb file is not yet stable enough for sensitive Gromacs MD simulation (step 8) even after cryo_fit's ample minimization step (e.g. step 4).

  - When Doo Nam ran `phenix.real_space_refine <https://www.phenix-online.org/documentation/reference/real_space_refine.html>`__ first, then run real_space_refined atomic model in cryo_fit, it was solved more than 2 cases.
  
  - If initial cc is too low, improve initial cc by fitting initial atomic model into a map,
  
   - either by following "How to improve initial cc?" in this FAQ
   - or adding/copying more atoms.
   
    - For example, when Doo Nam tried to fit a monomer into a trimer map, this error occured. However, simply adding dimer atomic models into an input pdb file and running cryo_fit again removed the error.
  
  - Less likely, but still a possible case is when the map weight is too high, lowering emweight_multiply_by may help.



I see "step 0 correlation coefficient: nan" at my 8_cryo_fit step.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- This often indicates that the initial atomic model is not placed into a cryo-EM map.

 - Therefore, please improve initial cc by fitting initial atomic model into a map (see "How to improve initial cc?" in this FAQ)

- If a user observed "Range checking error: Explanation:" error message at 8_cryo_fit step, please refer <I see "step 0 correlation coefficient: nan" and "Range checking error: Explanation:"> part in this FAQ



I see "step 0 correlation coefficient: nan" and "Range checking error: Explanation: During neighbor searching, we assign each particle to a grid based on its coordinates. If your system contains collisions or parameter errors that give particles very high velocities you might end up with some coordinates being +-Infinity or NaN (not-a-number). Obviously, we cannot put these on a grid, so this is usually where we detect those errors. Make sure your system is properly energy-minimized and that the potential energy seems reasonable before trying again." at my 8_cryo_fit step.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Based on Doo Nam's experiences, this error message may indicate between two cases/scenarios.

 1. Doo Nam observed this error when starting molecule is not stabilized structurally. There are two possible solutions.
 
  - Run `phenix.real_space_refine <https://www.phenix-online.org/documentation/reference/real_space_refine.html>`__ before cryo_fit. Then, provide real_space_refined molecule into cryo_fit. Then, most problems were solved.

  - When Doo Nam skipped minimization, this error occured. Since most users minimize the starting structure by default (cryo_fit default), most users do not need care about this. Besides, as of 9/18/2019, the default value of number_of_steps_for_minimization=20000 (which is a lot).


 2. It means that the map dimensions need to be larger. Therefore, check map size and solve a problem with VMD/EMAN2/relion like followings.

  - Like other MD simulations, gromacs need enough map box size to cover the atomic model to run (ziggle and wiggle). Refer `Waters seems to be out of the box <http://www.cgmartini.nl/index.php/component/kunena/10-other/367-sa-error>`__
  - For example, stuck-out red oxygen atoms outside the right edge of the box are the problem.
  - .. image:: ../images/cryo_fit_FAQ_sticking_out.png
  - In order to run any MD simulation (including cryo_fit), a box should be large enough like
  - .. image:: ../images/cryo_fit_FAQ_not_stick_out.png
  - Make map box size larger (see "How to enlarge map box size?" in this FAQ), and run cryo_fit again. A user can check map box size by VMD. Alternatively, remove sticking out atoms if these are unnecessary, then run cryo_fit again.
  - For protein modeling, Doo Nam would use `cryo_fit2  <https://github.com/cryoFIT/cryo_fit2>`__ which is not limited by box size requirement.



I see "The domain decomposition grid has shifted too much" at my 8_cryo_fit step
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Doo Nam observed "Source code file: domdec.c, line: 2633 Fatal error: Step 48520: The domain decomposition grid has shifted too much in the Y-direction around cell 0 1 0", when he used 4 numbers of cores in macOS.

- Inspired by `gromacs email list <https://www.mail-archive.com/gromacs.org_gmx-users@maillist.sys.kth.se/msg15136.html>`__, when he specified a lower number_of_cores_to_use, the problem was solved.

 - For example, phenix.cryo_fit <input.pdb> <input.ccp4> number_of_cores_to_use=2


I see "The initial cell size (xxx) is smaller than the cell size limit (xxx), change options -dd, -rdd or -rcon, see the log file for details" at my 8_cryo_fit step
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Doo Nam observed this error for 2 cases

 1. When he provided a pdb file that has unspecified/deleted region of a molecule. Even when vmd assisted map box/cell dimension is larger than initial molecule space, this error appeared.

 2. When he provided a pdb file that has small number of residues (e.g. 5~16 amino acids). Even when vmd assisted map box/cell dimension is larger than initial molecule space, this error appeared. This error appeared regardless of the existence of CRYST1 and SCALE header.


I see "Too many LINCS warnings" at my 8_cryo_fit step
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Doo Nam observed this error when starting molecule is not stabilized structurally. There are 3 possible solutions.

 1. Run `phenix.real_space_refine <https://www.phenix-online.org/documentation/reference/real_space_refine.html>`__ before cryo_fit. Then, provide real_space_refined molecule into cryo_fit. Then, most problems were solved.

 2. When Doo Nam skipped minimization, this error occured. Since most users minimize the starting structure by default (cryo_fit default), most users do not need care about this. Besides, as of 9/18/2019, the default value of number_of_steps_for_minimization=20000 (which is a lot).

 3. If starting molecule has non-standard chemical geometry that is too extreme that are not stabilized neither by `phenix.real_space_refine <https://www.phenix-online.org/documentation/reference/real_space_refine.html>`__ nor by cryo_fit minimization, then a user needs to fix those non-standard geometry manually.



I see "User's provided atomic model had 0.0 cc" in my cryo_fit.overall_log.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- It means that literally user's provided atomic model has no correlation to map to start with. 
- See "How to improve initial cc?" in this FAQ, and provide initially aligned atomic model to cryo_fit.


My model is shifted after `phenix.model_idealization <https://www.phenix-online.org/documentation/reference/model_idealization.html>`__.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- See 'My model is shifted after phenix.model_idealization' in `cryo_fit2_FAQ <cryo_fit2_FAQ.html>`__



When cryo_fit is useful?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- To `model dynamic conformational change <../tutorials/cryo_fit_movie.html>`__, cryo_fit is useful.

- To simply fit to cryo-EM map, cryo_fit is useful when `required RMSD > 7 Angstrom  <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1047847719301285?via%3Dihub>`__. When required RMSD <= 7 Angstrom, `phenix.real_space_refine <https://www.phenix-online.org/documentation/reference/real_space_refine.html>`__ tends to do similar fitting with faster speed. 


What to do after cryo_fit?
