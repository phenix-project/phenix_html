How to enlarge map box size?
--------------------------------------------------------
- Doo Nam uses `relion_image_handler <http://molecularart.dk/2015/11/cryo-em-how-to-change-box-size-and-pixel-size/>`__ to change map box size.
- For example, relion_image_handler --i user.mrc --new_box 370 --o user_box_size_370.mrc


How to generate and record movie?
---------------------------------------
- `Generate_record_movie_by_cryo_fit1 <../tutorials/cryo_fit_movie.html>`__


How to improve initial cc?
---------------------------------------
- `dock_in_map <https://www.phenix-online.org/documentation/reference/dock_in_map.html>`__ or UCSF Chimera's 'fit in map' or UCSF ChimeraX's isolde may improve initial cc.



I see "Fatal error: A charge group moved too far between two domain decomposition steps. This usually means that your system is not well equilibrated" at my 8_cryo_fit step.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Using macOS 10.13.6 helped rather than using Ubuntu 16.04. Maybe macOS has better numerical stability.
- One gromacs expert suggested to try smaller time_step_for_cryo_fit. 
- However but for Doo Nam, simply using macOS solved the problem.
- Less likely, but still a possible reason is that the map weight is too high. Therefore, lowering emweight_multiply_by may help.


I see "Fatal error: Number of grid cells is zero. Probably the system and box collapsed." at my 8_cryo_fit step.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- step_8 may be full of stepxb_nx.pdb.
- Most likely, this means that initial cc is too low for MD simulation.
- When Doo Nam ran real_space_refine first, then run real_space_refined atomic model in cryo_fit, it was solved.
- Alternatively, improve initial cc by fitting initial atomic model into a map (see "How to improve initial cc?" in this FAQ)
- Less likely, but still a possible case is when the map weight is too high, lowering emweight_multiply_by may help.



I see "step 0 correlation coefficient: nan" at my 8_cryo_fit step.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- This often indicates that the initial atomic model is not placed into a cryo-EM map.
- Please improve initial cc by fitting initial atomic model into a map (see "How to improve initial cc?" in this FAQ)


I see "step 0 correlation coefficient: nan" and "Range checking error: Explanation: During neighbor searching, we assign each particle to a grid based on its coordinates. If your system contains collisions or parameter errors that give particles very high velocities you might end up with some coordinates being +-Infinity or NaN (not-a-number). Obviously, we cannot put these on a grid, so this is usually where we detect those errors. Make sure your system is properly energy-minimized and that the potential energy seems reasonable before trying again." at my 8_cryo_fit step.

- It means that the map dimensions need to be larger. (see "When cryo_fit's automatic mrc to sit map format conversion may not work properly?" in this FAQ).
- Like other MD simulations, gromacs need enough map box size to cover the atomic model to run (ziggle and wiggle). Refer `Waters seems to be out of the box <http://www.cgmartini.nl/index.php/component/kunena/10-other/367-sa-error>`__
- For example, stuck-out red oxygen atoms outside the right edge of the box are the problem.
- .. image:: ../images/cryo_fit_FAQ_sticking_out.png
- In order to run any MD simulation (including cryo_fit), a box should be large enough like
- .. image:: ../images/cryo_fit_FAQ_not_stick_out.png
- Make map box size larger (see "How to enlarge map box size?" in this FAQ), and run cryo_fit again. You can check map box size by VMD. Alternatively, remove sticking out atoms if these are unnecessary, then run cryo_fit again.
- For protein modeling, I would use `cryo_fit2  <https://github.com/cryoFIT/cryo_fit2>`__ which is not limited by box size requirement. Most of the time, it better fits than cryo_fit1 in terms of fitting and geometry preservation anyway.



I see "User's provided atomic model had 0.0 cc" in my cryo_fit.overall_log.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- It means that literally user's provided atomic model has no correlation to map to start with. 

- See "How to improve initial cc?" in this FAQ, and provide initially aligned atomic model to cryo_fit.
