**How should I cite PHENIX?**

If you use PHENIX please cite:

PHENIX: a comprehensive Python-based system for macromolecular structure solution. P. D. Adams, P. V. Afonine, G. Bunk√≥czi, V. B. Chen, I. W. Davis, N. Echoo
ls, J. J. Headd, L.-W. Hung, G. J. Kapral, R. W. Grosse-Kunstleve, A. J. McCoy, N. W. Moriarty, R. Oeffner, R. J. Read, D. C. Richardson, J. S. Richardson, T. C. Terwilliger and P. H. Zwart. Acta Cryst. D66, 213-221 (2010).

Individual programs may have additional citations.

**How can I use multiple processors to run a job?**

Only `Autosol <../reference/autosol.html>`_,
`Autobuild <../reference/autobuild_gui.html>`_,
`Ligandfit <../reference/ligandfit_gui.html>`_,
`phaser.MRage <../reference/MRage.html>`_,
`phenix.refine <../reference/refine_gui.html>`_, the
`structure comparison GUI <../reference/structure_comparison.html>`_, and
phenix.find_tls_groups support runtime configuration of parallel processing.
In most cases this is done by adding the "nproc" keyword, for instance::

  phenix.autobuild data.mtz model.pdb seq.dat nproc=5

Equivalent controls are usually displayed in the GUI.  In addition to these
options, it is also possible to compile phenix.refine and Phaser with the
OpenMP library, which automatically parallelizes specific instructions such
as the FFT.  This requires using the source installer for Phenix, and adding
the argument "--openmp" to the install command.  Because of threading
conflicts, OpenMP is not compatible with the Phenix GUI.

**Where can I find sample data?**

You can find sample data in the directories located in ``$PHENIX/examples``.
Additionally there is sample MR data in ``$PHENIX/phaser/tutorial``.

In the `Phenix GUI <../phenix_gui.html>`_, tutorials may automatically be set up
as projects.  (You must run the specific programs manually, however.)

**Can I easily run autosol, autobuild or ligandfit with some sample data?**

You can run sample data with with a simple command. To run
``p9-sad`` sample data with autosol, you type::

  phenix.run_example  p9-sad


This command copies the ``$PHENIX/examples/p9-sad`` directory to
your working directory and executes the commands in the file ``run.sh``

**What sample data are available to run automatically?**

You can see which sample data are set up to run automatically by typing::

  phenix.run_example  --help

This command lists all the directories in ``$PHENIX/examples/`` that
have a command file ``run.sh`` ready to use. For example::

  phenix.run_example  --help

  PHENIX run_example script. Fri Jul  6 12:07:08 MDT 2007

  Use: phenix.run_example example_name [--all] [--overwrite]
  Data will be copied from PHENIX examples into subdirectories
  of this working directory
  If --all is set then all examples will be run (takes a long time!)
  If --overwrite is set then the script will overwrite subdirectories

  p9-build p9-sad


**Are any of the sample datasets annotated?**

The PHENIX tutorials listed on the `documentation index
<../phenix_documentation.html>`_ will walk you through sample datasets, telling
you what to look for in the output files. For example, the
`Tutorial 1: Solving a structure using SAD data <../tutorial_sad.html>`_
tutorial uses the ``p9-sad`` dataset as example. It tells you how to
run this example data in autosol and how to interpret the results.

**How is non-crystallographic symmetry handled in PHENIX?**

The treatment of NCS depends on the specific program or task:

  - In density modification (performed internally by RESOLVE, and used in
    Autosol, autobuild, phenix.multi_crystal_average, and related programs),
    NCS relationships (in the form of rotation/translation matrices) are used
    to average different parts of the map together, which usually improves
    phase quality.  The NCS operators can be derived from heavy-atom positions,
    the map itself, or a partial model, but this is normally done
    automatically (although we recommend specifying the number of NCS-related
    copies if you know what it should be).

  - In model-building (Autobuild), NCS is also used to copy pieces of the
    partial model to complete related chains.

  - In refinement (both in phenix.refine itself, and in the Autosol/Autobuild
    pipelines), NCS-related chains will be restrained to have similar
    conformations.  By default this will be done in torsion-angle space, which
    allows for local conformational changes if present, and also incorporates
    advanced sidechain-fitting features.  The NCS groups will be determined
    automatically based on sequence comparison.  Alternately, you may restrain
    the NCS groups to be globally similar, treating the relationships as rigid.
    This may work better in a few cases but is generally not recommended,
    especially since careful manual setup is usually required for optimal
    results.

Note that several programs may produce multiple forms of output specifying the
NCS relationships.  Files ending in .ncs_spec contain rotation and translation
matrices for use in RESOLVE.  Files ending in .phil contain atom selections
for use in phenix.refine.  In most cases, however, you can ignore these files,
as the NCS relationships will be detected automatically.

Graphical interface
-------------------

**How do I find a specific parameter in the GUI?**

Open the **Settings** menu, and select **Search all parameters**.  This can
be used to search for any keyword in the parameter name, label, or help text.

Working with reflection files
-----------------------------

**I have requested that the test set fraction be 0.05 (i.e. 5%), but Phenix
only flags 1% of reflections.  How do I make it use the number I specify?**

By default there is a limit of 2000 on the number of reflections that will be
picked for the test set; you don't really need more than this to ensure that
R-free is statistically significant and that the maximum likelihood
calculations work properly.  However, if you want to use a full 5%, you can
tell Phenix not to put any upper absolute limit.  In the `reflection file
editor <../reflection_file_editor.html>`_ in the GUI, click
"More options" in the R-free flags section of the editor, and delete the
field labeled "Maximum number of reflections in test set".

  number_of_parallel_models=1 n_cycle_rebuild_max=1

Maps
----

**How do I obtain an anomalous difference map in Phenix?**

If you have anomalous data (separate F+ and F- or I+ and I-) and use this
as input, both `phenix.maps <../create_maps.html>`_ and
`phenix.refine <../refinement.html>`__ will automatically output the anomalous
difference map in the map coefficients MTZ file.  Note that depending on the
application, you may need to manually open the MTZ file in Coot to get the
anomalous map to appear.


Other
-----

**How can I obtain phases and Hendrickson-Lattman coefficients for my model
and data?**

There is `a program specifically for this purpose
<../reference/reciprocal_space_arrays.html>`__; you can find in in the Phenix
GUI under "Reflection tools".
