Frequently asked questions about ligand fitting
===============================================


**What can I do if ligandfit says "this version does not seem big enough"?**

Ligandfit tries to automatically determine the size of solve or resolve,
but if your data is very high resolution or a very large unit cell, you
can get the message::

  ***************************************************
  Sorry, this version does not seem big enough...
  (Current value of isizeit is  30)
  Unfortunately your computer will only accept a size of  30
  with your current settings.
  You might try cutting back the resolution
  You might try "coarse_grid" to reduce memory
  You might try "unlimit" allow full use of memory
  ***************************************************

You cannot get rid of this problem by specifying the resolution with
``resolution=4.0`` because ligandfit
use the resolution cutoff you specify
in all calculations, but the high-res data is still carried along.

The easiest solution to this problem is to edit your data file to have lower-
resolution data. You can do it like this:

  phenix.reflection_file_converter huge.sca --sca=big.sca --resolution=4.0

or in the GUI, use the `reflection file editor <reflection_file_editor.html>`_.

A second solution is to tell ligandfit to
ignore the high-res data
explicitly with one of these commands (on the command line or in the GUI)::

  resolve_command="'resolution 200 4.0'"
  solve_command="'resolution 200 4.0'"
  resolve_pattern_command="'resolution 200 4.0'"

Note the two sets of quotes; both are required for this command-line input. Just one set of quotes is required in the GUI.
These commands are applied after all other inputs in resolve/solve/resolve_pattern and therefore all data outside these limits will be ignored.
