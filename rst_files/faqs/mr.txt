General issues
--------------

**How do I know if Phaser has solved my structure?**

This is answered in
detail in the section "Has Phaser solved it?" in the `main Phaser manual
<../reference/phaser.html>`_, but it can be summarized as follows: the final
translation function Z score (TFZ) should be above 8, and the log-likelihood
gain (LLG) should be positive and as high as possible.  Of course, as with
experimental phasing, the ability to `autobuild most of the model
<../reference/autobuild_gui.html>`_ is the single best measure of a correct
solution; alternately, running a single round of `refinement
<../reference/refine_gui.html>`_ should result in an R-free below 0.50.
Note that if the R-free is above 0.5 after refinement, this often indicates
indicates that the solution is actually incorrect - especially when combined
with sub-standard TFZ and/or LLG values.  Just because Phaser finds a solution,
does not mean that it has correctly solved the structure!

**Why doesn't Phaser report an R-factor?**

The R-factor is far less
sensitive than the TFZ and LLG scores, especially when searching for
remote homologs or a small part of the overall scattering mass.  Phaser
does record R-factors for the rigid-body refinement step towards the
end of a run, which can be found in the logfile.  However, unless these
values are relatively low (< 40%), they are not reliable indicators of
solution quality, which is why only the Z-scores and LLG are reported in
the GUI.

**What if I don't get a good solution?**

This is also covered in detail
in the `main Phaser manual <../reference/phaser.html>`_, in the section "What
to do in difficult cases".

**What resolution cutoff should I use?**

In short, in most cases you should let Phaser choose the resolution cutoffs.
Phaser uses the assumed accuracy of the model (expressed directly as RMSD or
indirectly as sequence identity), the size of the model, and both the
resolution and number of diffraction observations to determine the signal that
will be obtained for each model as a function of resolution.  This is used both
to determine a resolution cutoff that should be sufficient for a successful MR
search, and an optimal search order for the models.  The effects of bulk
solvent at low resolution are taken into account internally, so you do not need
to specify a low-resolution cutoff either.

**Should I use the output MTZ file from Phaser for refinement?**

No, it is always best to use the original data file for refinement.  The MTZ
file from Phaser contains map coefficients, but in most cases you will find
that better maps can be obtained by immediately running a round of refinement
or automated re-building.

.. _composition-search-ensemble-relation:

**How are the composition and search ensembles related?**

Technically, they aren't connected.  The ensembles are used in the actual MR
search; the composition only tells Phaser what to expect for the overall
scattering mass of the asymmetric unit (an important factor in the maximum
likelihood scoring).  Although you may only specify one sequence per component,
you can instead provide a molecular weight for a collection of chains.  You may
also split a model into smaller ensembles (for instance, different domains)
while keeping the composition the same, or use a multi-chain search model while
specifying a sequence file for each chain.

**How can I make Phaser go faster?**

Phaser is under continuous development, with a lot of emphasis being placed on
speed, so anything we could advise here is probably already being done
automatically!  Because Phaser now automatically chooses the lowest resolution
expected to give a clear solution, changing the resolution limits is not
advisable and may even lengthen the run times.  It's a good idea to set up a
Phaser run to find all copies of all components in one job, because this allows
Phaser to choose the optimal search order and to amalgamate solutions for
multiple copies found in one search.

**Can PHENIX do MRSAD?**

Yes, PHENIX can run MRSAD (molecular replacement, combined with SAD phases) by
using molecular replacement information in the process of determining the
anomalous scatterer substructure.  However, this requires separate steps for
carrying out the MR and finding the substructure.  There are two simple ways to
do this; both are described in the `AutoSol documentation
<../reference/autosol.html>`_.

**I am using a dimer as my search model.  Why am I getting a warning that the
unit cell is too full?**

Remember, the composition of the asymmetric unit is specified independently
of the model.  If you have supplied a single sequence to define the
composition, check to make sure that you have specified that the contents
of the asymmetric unit include two copies.

.. _sculptor-ensembler-order:

**I want to create an ensemble of models. Should I run Sculptor first and then
Ensembler, or the other way round?**

Unfortunately, neither way is optimal. When Sculptor is run first, it removes
residues from the model, and this may impact on Ensembler's ability to do an
optimal superposition. If the default *SSM* matching is used, the fragmentation
of secondary structure elements (prominent when models are distant) may result
in incorrect matching, although this is rare. When Ensembler is run first, and
*trimming* is switched on, the resulting main-chain trace can contain many short
fragments, which will be discarded by Sculptor since these cannot be reliably
matched to the alignment sequence, and the completeness of the resulting model
is further decreased. The best compromise is probably to run Sculptor first, so
that the sequence-to-chain alignment could be performed optimally. In common
cases, this does not impair superposition drastically, since there are still
many sites to use. In case *SSM* alignment fails, other matching algorithms
(e.g. residue sequence numbers) can be used.

Refinement after MR
-------------------

**What should I run after Phaser finds a good solution?**

We usually recommend one (or both) of these two options (and see the next
question for advice on more difficult cases):

- If the search model is the same protein (or close enough) and is not
  expected to have large conformational cahnges, run phenix.refine using
  the default strategy
  for at least 8-10 macrocycles, but with options adjusted as appropriate for
  the resolution of the data: for instance, adding NCS restraints at low
  resolution if multiple copies of a chain are present, or adding the solvent
  update at moderate-to-high resolution.
- Run AutoBuild; if the search model is of a significantly different protein,
  turn off "rebuild-in-place" mode so it will build an entirely new model.

**I ran Phaser, it found a solution, then I ran phenix.refine, and the R-free
is stuck above 0.4 (but below 0.5).  How do I fix this?**

This is an open-ended question, and there are multiple explanations and
solutions possible.  We usually recommend a standard series of checks:

- Run `Xtriage <../reference/xtriage_gui.html>`_ and check your data for any
  pathologies that may make refinement difficult (such as twinning, incomplete
  data, or translational NCS).
- It is very important that the search model already match the sequence of the
  target protein.  If you run Phaser with a homologous structure as input, you
  should first run Sculptor to edit the search model as needed.  (This is not
  the same as homology modeling - it simply removes inappropriate atoms,
  renames and renumbers residues, and adjusts B-factors.)  Refinement will not
  correct any residual problems if you skip this step.
- Check whether the MR solution is truly complete - this means that you have
  placed enough copies of the search model, and that the search model already
  covers most or all of the target.  Gaps in crystal packing or unusually large
  blobs of difference density may be indicative of missing scatterers.  At low
  resolution the difference density will be weaker, but you can still inspect
  the lattice.  If you are missing significant parts of the model, this will
  limit how much lower R-factors can get.
- Make sure you are running enough cycles of refinement.  Sometimes it will
  take a long time to converge; the default three cycles is the minimum
  recommnded.

If all of the both indicate that model and data are reasonably sensible, it is
likely that there are differences/model errors that are beyond the radius of
convergence of refinement.  Fortunately, this is usually easy to recognize in
the difference maps even at low resolution; for instance, a representative
test case at 4.0Å (described in DiMaio et al. 2013):

.. image:: ../images/1isr_1ewt_ref1.png

Here we can see very clearly that the model is simply misfit (although the
majority of the protein, mostly outside the field of view, is more or less
correct).  In this case, there are several tools you can try, many of which
were specifically designed to cope with this class of problems:

- If you have moderate-to-high-resolution data (at least 3.0Å), you can try
  building an entirely new model in `AutoBuild
  <../reference/autobuild_gui.html>`_.  This is slower than refinement, but it
  has a very wide radius of convergence.
- The model morphing procedure may be helpful; this is available both as an
  option in AutoBuild, and a `standalone program
  <../reference/morph_model.html>`_.
- The `hybrid Rosetta-Phenix refinement <../reference/rosetta_refine.html>`_
  was also designed to deal with cases like this.
- `DEN refinement <../reference/den_refine.html>`_ was also designed to deal
  with structures that need more aggressive improvement, and has proven useful
  in many similar cases.
- In extreme cases, `MR-Rosetta <../reference/mr_rosetta.html>`_ may be tried;
  this is capable of improving **very** poor MR solutions, but is significantly
  more computationally expensive than the other methods.
- Sometimes just adding simulated annealing in phenix.refine will be enough
  (although for the example pictured above, it was not).

Additionally, if multiple structures of the same protein are available for use
as search models, we recommend checking whether any of these is closer to the
target than the current search model.

Phaser-MR GUI
-------------

**Do I actually have to include multiple models in my ensembles?**

No, we use "ensemble" in this context to refer to any search model; in many
cases a single model is adequate to solve the structure (and these may
be much easier to work with).

**What is the difference between "high resolution" and "high resolution for
refinement"?**

The latter is applied during the "refinement and phasing"
step only; for rotation and translation searches, the first parameter is
used.

**How do I search for multiple unique ensembles?**

The "Search procedure" tab allows you to set up this procedure.  To search for
multiple independent ensembles representing different entities in a
complex ("a AND b AND c"), click the "Add search"
button below the tab, and for each search, check the ensemble(s) to be
used at that step.  The searches will be performed in the order they appear
in the GUI.  Note that this is **not** the same as checking multiple
ensembles for a single search, as described in the next question.

**How do I tell Phaser to pick the best solution from among several similar
ensembles?**

To try multiple alternative ensembles (corresponding to the same actual
entity in the crystal) at once ("a OR b OR c"), check the
box next to each ensemble you want Phaser to try for a single search; only
one of these will actually be placed in the output model.
(You can, of course, specify any combination of searches and ensembles,
for instance "(a OR b) AND c", which would be two separate search
instructions.)

**I want to run a new search in Phaser starting from the results of a
previous job.  How do I specify this?**

If the previous job was run in
the Phenix GUI, you can select it from the drop-down menu labeled "Use
partial solution from previous job" in the "Input and general options" tab.
This will automatically load the solution.  Note that unlike the CCP4i
interface, Phaser-MR in Phenix does not make use of .sol files, since the
information is passed internally.  You should then load the new ensembles
to search for; ensembles that were used in the previous run do not need to
be re-loaded unless you wish to find more copies.  If you have already
provided complete information about the composition correctly, this will
not need to be changed.

**How do I run a new search starting from an existing model in the correct
orientation and translation?**

This might apply if you have a refined model, or a solution from another
program.  In this case, you should add the model as an ensemble, and check the
box "Ensemble is fixed partial solution".  This will instruct Phaser to accept
the input coordinates without modification, and skip to the next ensemble to
search for.  You do not need to specify a separate search for this ensemble, as
it will be included automatically.

**How do I tell the program to use a local PDB mirror instead of fetching
entries remotely?**

See the `general FAQ list <index.html#pdb_mirror>`__.

MR-Rosetta
----------

**Why does mr_rosetta bomb and say "error while loading shared libraries:
libdevel.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory"?**

This may indicate that somewhere your system is defining the shared libraries
that Rosetta needs, and these are for a place that is not where Rosetta
expects them to be. You can try to ignore the previous definitions
this way:

If you are using the bash or sh shells::

  export PHENIX_TRUST_OTHER_ENV=1

or csh (C-shell)::

  setenv PHENIX_TRUST_OTHER_ENV 1

in the script where you run mr_rosetta, or before you run it from the command
line.

**Why does mr_rosetta or mr_model_preparation bomb and say
"RuntimeError: Cannot contact EBI DbFetch service"?**

This could mean just what it says...but also it could mean
that you are behind a firewall and there is a proxy server you need
to go through. You can use the following
command to specify the proxy server (replacing it with YOUR proxy server).

If you are using the bash or sh shells::

  export HTTP_PROXY=proxyout.mydomain.edu:8080

or csh (C-shell)::

  setenv HTTP_PROXY proxyout.mydomain.edu:8080

**Problems installing Rosetta? Here are some suggestions:**

- Download rosetta_source and rosetta_database separately.  The bundle
  doesn't contain all the files.

- Compilation fails on RHEL 6.1 (gcc 4.5 issue) but sails on RHEL 5.5.

- Make sure the environment is set correctly: ``$PHENIX_ROSETTA_PATH``
  must point to the Rosetta installation directory
  (where rosetta_source and rosetta_database sit). (Note there was a typo
  in documentation with ROSETTTA instead of ROSETTA; fixed now.)

- all directories in the Rosetta installation must be made accessible to
  users::

    find $PHENIX_ROSETTA_PATH -type d -exec chmod 755 '{}' \;
