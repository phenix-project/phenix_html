Purpose
-------

find\_ncs\_from\_density is a tool to identify NCS relationships
directly from an electron density map specified with a map coefficients
file. It writes out the NCS operators in a format that can be read by
find\_ncs and by the PHENIX wizards. Usually find\_ncs\_from\_density is
used through find\_ncs (phenix.find\_ncs contains
find\_ncs\_from\_density).

Usage
-----

How find\_ncs\_from\_density works:
-----------------------------------

-  The find\_ncs\_from\_density algorithm first identifies potential
   locations of centers of macromolecules in the density map by finding
   maxima of the local RMS density using
   phenix.guess\_molecular\_centers.
-  Then it cuts out a sphere of density centered at a trial center and
   carries out an FFT-based rotation-translation search to find all
   occurrences of similar density in the asymmetric unit of your map.
-  The region over which NCS-related correlation is high is identified
   and the operators are written out as a "find\_ncs.ncs\_spec" file
   that can be read by the phenix wizards and a
   "find\_ncs.phenix\_refine" file that can be read by phenix.refine.
-  You can run the algorithm as a whole or you can run each part
   separately with phenix.guess\_molecular\_centers and
   phenix.find\_ncs\_from\_density.

*Output files from find\_ncs\_from\_density*
--------------------------------------------

**find\_ncs\_from\_density.ncs\_spec**: A formatted file that can be
read by phenix.find\_ncs and the PHENIX wizards that specifies the NCS
operators. **temp\_dir/ncs\_avg\_map\_coeffs.mtz**: This is an mtz file
with just one averaged NCS region written out in space group P1.

Examples

Standard run of find\_ncs\_from\_density:
-----------------------------------------

Running find\_ncs\_from\_density is easy. From the command-line you can
type:

::

    phenix.find_ncs_from_density  map_coeffs.mtz

Possible Problems
-----------------

If your molecule is large, you may wish to increase the radius used for
NCS identification (density\_radius) and the peak separation
(peak\_separation). If your molecule has pseudo-symmetry you may also
want to increase these parameters.

If you know how many NCS copies are present, you may wish to specifying
that with ncs\_copies\_max.
