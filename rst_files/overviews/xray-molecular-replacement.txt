Molecular Replacement
=====================

**Why**

One of the biggest problems in crystallography is the phase problem,
hence the use of experimental phasing. An increasingly popular alternative 
approach, called molecular replacement (MR), uses known structures to 
solve the phase problem. When a structurally similar model (e.g., homologue) 
is available, this model is computationally placed in the unit cell 
containing the unknown structure. An initial electron density map is 
then calculated with the phases from the homologue and the observed 
structure factors.

The success of MR calculations depends on how much signal can be
extracted from the data using the particular model, which in turn 
depends on a combination of the model quality and completeness, 
data resolution, and number of diffraction observations. For crystals 
of medium-sized proteins diffracting to moderate resolution, for 
example, the sequence identity between the molecule and homologue 
should be >25-30% and the r.m.s. deviation between C⍺ atoms should 
be <2.0 Å.


**How**

In Phenix, the primary program for performing molecular replacement is
Phaser. This requires experimental diffraction data, atomic model(s),
the sequence of the molecule in the crystal, and typically some estimate
of the number of molecules in the crystal. Phaser uses maximum-likelihood 
algorithms to determine the rotation of the model(s) with respect to the 
unit cell, and then the translation of the rotated model(s) within the unit 
cell. The output of this process, if successful, is a PDB file containing 
the placed model(s) and an MTZ file containing coefficients for the electron 
density made using the placed model(s) and the observed experimental amplitudes.

**Common issues**

-  No solutions were found even with a good search model: There are multiple 
   causes, but a common one is that a multiple domain protein has undergone 
   a conformational change. In this case, you should split the structure and 
   perform molecular replacement on the individual domains using separate 
   search models. An alternative cause, thankfully less common, is that the 
   crystallized molecule is not the intended one. For this reason, it is always 
   prudent to use the "Search PDB Symmetry" tool in the Phenix GUI to check 
   the cell dimensions and space group against the PDB. A third possibility is 
   that the space group is incorrect (e.g., if twinning increases the apparent 
   symmetry of the diffraction pattern), thus it is always good to run Xtriage 
   in the "Data analysis" section of the Phenix GUI.

**Related programs**

-  `phenix.MRage <../reference/MRage.html>`__: This program uses Phaser to
   perform highly automated molecular replacement. In its simplest form,
   it uses experimental diffraction data and a sequence to solve a
   molecular replacement problem.
-  `phenix.sculptor <../reference/sculptor.html>`__: This program can improve 
   models for molecular replacement, by trimming off parts of the model that 
   are unlikely to be preserved in the target structure.
-  `phenix.ensembler <../reference/ensembler.html>`__: This program prepares 
   ensembles for molecular replacement. An ensemble is a set of structurally 
   related models that have been superimposed with respect to each other, 
   typically using a conserved structural core.
   Phenix.ensembler automates the process of superimposing models.
-  `phenix.morph\_model <../reference/morph_model.html>`__: This program
   can improve an initial model after molecular replacement by locally moving 
   the structure to better fit the electron density map. This is especially 
   powerful when the molecular replacement solution is structurally too different 
   to provide phases for map interpretation or automated model building.
-  `phenix.mr\_rosetta <../reference/mr_rosetta.html>`__: This program can
   improve an initial model after molecular replacement by using the Rosetta 
   program to modify the model such that it moves closer to the true structure, 
   while also improving the fit to electron density map. This is especially 
   powerful when the molecular replacement solution is structurally too
   different to provide phases for map interpretation or automated model
   building.
