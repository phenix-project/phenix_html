Molecular Replacement
=====================

**Why**

One of the biggest problems in crystallography is the phase problem,
hence the use of experimental phasing. An alternative approach, which is
increasingly more popular, is the use of known structures to solve the
phase problem. This approach is called molecular replacement - a model,
very similar in structure to the one crystallized, is computationally
placed in the crystallographic unit cell. From this model, phases can be
calculated and used to start the process of interpreting the electron
density map.

**How**

In Phenix the primary program for performing molecular replacement is
Phaser. This requires experimental diffraction data, an atomic model(s),
the sequence of the molecule in the crystal and typically some estimate
of the number of molecules in the crystal. Phaser uses maximum
likelihood algorithms to determine the rotation of the model(s) with
respect to the unit cell, and then the translation of the rotated
model(s) within the unit cell. The output of this process, if
successful, is a PDB file containing the placed model(s) and an MTZ file
containing coefficients for the electron density made using the places
model(s) and the observed experimental amplitudes. For an introduction

**Common issues**

-  No solutions were found even with a good search model: There are
   multiple causes, but one not uncommon reason is that a multiple
   domain protein has undergone a conformational change. In this case
   the molecular should be divided into the individual domains and the
   molecular replacement performed with each domain as a separate search
   molecule. An alternative cause, thankfully less common, is that the
   crystallized molecule is not the intended one. For this reason it is
   always prudent to use the "Search PDB Symmetry" tool in the Phenix
   GUI to check cell dimensions and space group against the PDB.

**Related programs**

-  `phenix.MRage <../reference/MRage.html>`__: This program uses Phaser to
   perform highly automated molecular replacement. In its simplest form
   it can take experimental diffraction data and a sequence to solve a
   molecular replacement problem.
-  `phenix.sculptor <../reference/sculptor.html>`__: This program can be
   used to prepare models for molecular replacement, by trimming loops
   where there are expected to be insertions of deletions based on
   sequence alignment. It can also trim side chains and modify other
   properties of the model such as atomic displacement parameters.
-  `phenix.ensembler <../reference/ensembler.html>`__: This program can be
   used to prepare ensembles for molecular replacement. An ensemble is a
   set of structurally related models that have been superimposed with
   respect to each other, typically using a conserved structural core.
   Phenix.ensembler automates the process of superimposing models.
-  `phenix.morph\_model <../reference/morph_model.html>`__: This program
   can be used to improve an initial model after molecular replacement
   by locally moving the structure to better fit the electron density
   map. This is especially powerful in those cases where the molecular
   replacement solution is structurally too different to provide phases
   for map interpretation or automated model building.
-  `phenix.mr\_rosetta <../reference/mr_rosetta.html>`__: This program can
   be used to improve an initial model after molecular replacement by
   using the Rosetta program to modify the model such that it moves
   closer to the true structure, while also improving the fit to
   electron density map. This is especially powerful in those cases
   where the molecular replacement solution is structurally too
   different to provide phases for map interpretation or automated model
   building.
