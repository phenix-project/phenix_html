Assessing Data Quality
======================

**Why**

The first step after data processing is analysis of the diffraction
data to assess quality and detect any pathologies that might make
structure solution difficult. Data quality can be quantified in terms of
resolution of diffraction, anomalous signal-to-noise, and consistency
with prior knowledge about diffraction from crystals. Possible
pathologies include twinning, translational non-crystallographic
symmetry, anisotropy, and missed symmetry elements.

**How**

In Phenix the phenix.xtriage program is used to analyze data to
assess quality and detect possible problems. For most uses the program
only needs to be given a reflection file containing the data set you
wish to analyze. Running phenix.xtriage will generate information about
the data set, which are best viewed in the GUI as graphs and tables. An
overall assessment of the data is given in the first section of the
output.

**Common issues**

-  Interpetation of twinning results: there are two parts to testing for
   twinning; whether the overall intensity statistics look normal, and
   then tests for specific twinning operations. Both of these kinds of
   tests need to indicate twinning for the data set to be considered
   twinned. In some cases the tests of specific twinning operations
   might return a high twin fraction but the overall intensity
   statistics look normal. This should not be interepreted as twinning,
   rather, more likely, a missed symmetry element (phenix.xtriage might
   indeed suggest a higher symmetry).

**Related programs and Documentation**

-  `phenix.plan\_sad\_experiment <../reference/plan_sad_experiment.html>`__: 
   This tool (available in the GUI) allows you to plan your SAD data 
   collection strategy by estimating the anomalous
   signal and the probability of solving your structure by SAD based on
   the anomalously-scattering atoms, the wavelength, the size of your
   molecule, and the overall I/sigI for your dataset.


-  `phenix.anomalous\_signal <../reference/anomalous_signal.html>`__: 
   This tool is like 
   `phenix.plan\_sad\_experiment <../reference/plan_sad_experiment.html>`__
   except that it uses your measured data to give much more accurate
   estimates.  It uses your scaled data and two half-dataset scaled datasets
   from your data that can be created with 
   `phenix.scale\_and\_merge <../reference/scale_and_merge.html>`__
   to give an estimate of the anomalous signal in your data and the 
   probability of solving your structure by SAD, taking into account the
   number of sites in the substructure.


-  `phenix.data\_viewer <../reference/data_viewer.html>`__: 
   This GUI program allows you to visualize reciprocal space data either in
   3-dimensions or 2-dimensions. This can be very useful for detecting
   systematic problems with data completeness (e.g. missing cones,
   wedges).


-  `phenix.explore\_metric\_symmetry <../reference/explore_metric_symmetry.html>`__:
   This program allows you to test whether your crystal lattice is
   consistent with other lattices/symmetries. It also can test whether
   two lattices are related. (Command line only).


-  `Using unmerged data in Phenix <../reference/unmerged_data.html>`__:
   Unmerged data can be analyzed in Phenix to provide useful
   information, in particular the new CC1/2 and CC\* statistics. The
   program phenix.merging\_statistics can be used to calculate these and
   a number of other statistics.  Additionally the program 
   `phenix.scale\_and\_merge <../reference/scale_and_merge.html>`__ can 
   scale unmerged data for you.
