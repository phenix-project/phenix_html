Assessing Data Quality
======================

**Why**

The first step after data processing is analysis of the diffraction
data to assess quality and detect any pathologies that might make
structure solution difficult. Data quality can be quantified in terms of
resolution of diffraction, anomalous signal-to-noise, and consistency
with prior knowledge about diffraction from crystals. 

Possible pathologies include twinning, translational non-crystallographic
symmetry, anisotropy, and missed symmetry elements. For example, crystals 
are considered ‘twinned’ if two or more separate crystals (domains) are 
intergrown in such a way that they share some crystal lattice 
points in a symmetrical manner. And translational noncrystallographic 
symmetry (tNCS) occurs when two or more independent copies of a molecule 
or assembly have a similar orientation in the asymmetric unit of the crystal. 

**How**

The *phenix.xtriage* program analyzes data to assess quality and
detect possible problems. For most uses, the program only requires a 
reflection file containing the data set you wish to analyze. Running 
*phenix.xtriage* generates information about the data set, which is best
viewed in the GUI as graphs and tables. The first section of the output
provides an overall assessment of the data.

**Common issues**

*Interpretation of twinning results*: There are two parts to testing for
twinning — determining whether the overall intensity statistics look
normal, and testing for specific twinning operations. Both kinds of
tests need to indicate twinning for the data set to be considered
twinned. In some cases, the tests of specific twinning operations return
a high twin fraction but the overall intensity statistics look normal;
this should not be interpreted as twinning. More likely, a symmetry element
is missing, and phenix.xtriage might suggest a higher symmetry.

-  `phenix.plan\_sad\_experiment <../reference/plan_sad_experiment.html>`__: 
   This tool allows you to plan your SAD data collection strategy by 
   estimating the anomalous signal and the probability of solving your 
   structure by SAD based on the anomalously-scattering atoms, wavelength, size 
   of your molecule, and overall I/sigI for your dataset.


-  `phenix.anomalous\_signal <../reference/anomalous_signal.html>`__: 
   This tool is like 
   `phenix.plan\_sad\_experiment <../reference/plan_sad_experiment.html>`__
   except that it uses your measured data to give much more accurate
   estimates. Specifically, it uses your scaled data, two half-dataset files 
   of your scaled data, the name of the anomalously-scattering atom, and the 
   number of sites in the substructure in order to estimate the anomalous 
   signal in your data and the probability of solving your structure by SAD. 
   You can create the necessary scaled half-datasets using 
   `phenix.scale\_and\_merge <../reference/scale_and_merge.html>`__.


-  `HKLviewer <http://cci.lbl.gov/docs/cctbx/doc_hklviewer/>`__:
   This program visualizes reciprocal space data, such as reflection data and their uncertainties. This can be very useful for detecting problems, such as data incompleteness (e.g., missing cones or
   wedges), TNCS and twinning.


-  `phenix.explore\_metric\_symmetry <../reference/explore_metric_symmetry.html>`__:
   This program tests whether your crystal lattice is
   consistent with other lattices/symmetries. It also can test whether
   two lattices are related. (Command line only).


-  `Using unmerged data in Phenix <../reference/unmerged_data.html>`__:
   You can analyze unmerged data in Phenix to provide useful
   information, including the new CC1/2 and CC\* statistics. The
   program phenix.merging\_statistics calculates these and
   a number of other statistics. The program 
   `phenix.scale\_and\_merge <../reference/scale_and_merge.html>`__  
   scales unmerged data for you.
