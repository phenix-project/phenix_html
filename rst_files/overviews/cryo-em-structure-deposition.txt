Cryo-EM Structure Deposition
============================

**Background**

Once a protein structure is solved it is usually deposited
in the World Wide Protein Data Bank (wwPDB). This is necessary for
publication as most journals require a PDBID to be included in any
manuscript under review that describes a new crystallographic structure.
The wwPDB is an invaluable resource that contains over 150,000 structures
(as of June 2019).

**Procedure**

The model files (PDB and mmCIF) generated by phenix.refine contain information
that is required when depositing a structure to the wwPDB. Starting in July 2019,
the wwPDB will only accept model files in mmCIF for deposition.

To generate a model file suitable to deposition, a two stage process is
currently recommended:

#. By default, phenix.real_space_refine will output model files in mmCIF and PDB format.
   If you turned off the option for mmCIF output, run a final cycle of
   phenix.real_space_refine that writes mmCIF files for model and data (this can be set in
   the Output section of the GUI).

#. The model file (mmCIF) and a sequence file can then be processed with
   mmtbx.prepare\_pdb\_deposition program to create a mmCIF file with the sequence.
   This program requires the full sequence for the macromolecule to be provided.
   In the GUI, this program is in the "PDB Deposition" section of tools.

   This program takes the mmCIF output from phenix.refine and adds the sequence
   information necessary for deposition into the Proten Data Bank.

   This program submits your model and data in CIF format to the PDB OneDep
   server to get a validation report in PDF an XML formats.
