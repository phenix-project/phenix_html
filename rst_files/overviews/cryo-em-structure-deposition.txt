Cryo-EM Structure Deposition
=====================================

**Why**

Once a crystallographic structure is solved it is usually deposited
in the World Wide Protein Data Bank (wwPDB). This is necessary for
publication as most journals require a PDBID to be included in any
manuscript under review that describes a new crystallographic structure.
The wwPDB is an invaluable resource that contains many tens of thousands
of structures, which are increasingly used to solve new crystal
structures by molecular replacement.

**How**

The PDB files generated by phenix.refine contain information that is
useful when depositing a structure to the wwPDB. However, a much better
route is to deposit mmCIF format files, for both model and data. To do
this, a two stage process is currently recommended: running a final cycle
of phenix.refine that writes mmCIF files for model and data (this can be
set in the Output section of the GUI). The model file and a sequence file
can then be processed with mmtbx.prepare\_pdb\_deposition program (from the
command line) to create a mmCIF file with the sequence. This program
requires the full sequence for the macromolecule to be provided. The
result of this will be a mmCIF file containing the model, and a mmCIF
file containing the data. These files can then be directly uploaded as
part of the wwPDB deposition process.
