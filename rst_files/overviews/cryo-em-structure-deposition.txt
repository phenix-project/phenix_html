Cryo-EM Structure Deposition
============================

**Why**

Once a protein structure is solved, it is usually deposited
in the World Wide Protein Data Bank (wwPDB). This is necessary for
publication as most journals require a PDB ID to be included in any
manuscript that describes a new crystallographic structure.
The wwPDB is an invaluable resource that contains over 190,000 structures
(as of July 2021).

**Procedure**

The model files (PDB and mmCIF) generated by *phenix.real_space_refine* contain
information that is required when depositing a structure to the wwPDB. However, 
the wwPDB currently only accepts model files in mmCIF for deposition. 

To generate a model file suitable to deposition, a two stage process is
currently recommended:

#. By default, *phenix.real_space_refine* will output model files in mmCIF and 
   PDB format. If you turned off the option for mmCIF output, run a final cycle of
   *phenix.real_space_refine* that writes mmCIF files for model and data. This can be set in
   the Output section of the GUI.

#. You can then process the model file (mmCIF) and a sequence file with the
   *mmtbx.prepare\_pdb\_deposition* program to create a mmCIF file with the sequence.
   This program requires the full sequence for the macromolecule to be provided.
   In the GUI, this program is in the "PDB Deposition" section of tools.

**Related programs**

-  `phenix.validation_cryoem <../reference/validation_cryo_em.html>`_: This program 
   can be used to generate the table of statistics.
-  `phenix.get_pdb_validation_report <../reference/get_pdb_validation_report.html>`__:
   This program submits your model and data in CIF format to the PDB OneDep
   server to get a validation report in PDF an XML formats.
