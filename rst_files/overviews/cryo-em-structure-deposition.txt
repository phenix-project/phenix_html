Cryo-EM Structure Deposition
=====================================

**Why**

Once a protein structure is solved it is usually deposited
in the World Wide Protein Data Bank (wwPDB). This is necessary for
publication as most journals require a PDBID to be included in any
manuscript under review that describes a new crystallographic structure.
The wwPDB is an invaluable resource that contains many tens of thousands
of structures, which are increasingly used to solve new crystal
structures by molecular replacement.

**How**

The model files generated by phenix.real_space_refine contain information that
is useful when depositing a structure to the wwPDB. However, a much better
route is to deposit mmCIF format files, for the model. To get a mmCIF format
file in the phenix.real_space_refine GUI, the process is similar to that in
phenix.refine. In the "Output" section of the "Input/Output" panel, there is a
check box labelled "Write final model in mmCIF." After the model is output, you
can add the sequence to the file with the mmtbx.prepare\_pdb\_deposition program
(from the command line). This program requires the full sequence for the
macromolecule to be provided. The result of this will be a mmCIF file containing
the model.

   This program submits your model and data in CIF format to the PDB OneDep
   server to get a validation report in PDF an XML formats.
