Assessing Map Quality (cryo-EM)
===============================

**Why**

The first step after data processing is analysis to assess data 
quality and detect any pathologies that might thwart structure solution.
The quality of the reconstruction, and therefore the interpretability
of a cryo-EM map, can deteriorate from many causes including structural
heterogeneity, radiation damage, and beam-induced sample movement. 

Data quality is typically expressed by the resolution, but this term
has a different meaning for cryo-EM than crystallographic experiments. 
For a crystallographic data set, resolution depends on the largest
angle to which diffracted beams were measured (or equivalently, the shortest
distance between reciprocal-lattice planes). For a cryo-EM map, the overall
resolution (d\ :sub:`FSC`) is usually defined as the maximum spatial 
resolution at which the information content of the map is reliable.

The cryo-EM resolution is obtained by analyzing the Fourier shell correlation 
(FSC) for two cryo-EM half-maps binned in resolution shells. If the macromolecule 
is structurally heterogeneous, a single resolution value is adequate. 
'Local resolutions' are also assigned to different map regions. 
 

**How**

The *phenix.mtriage* program estimates the resolution of cryo-EM maps
using several approaches, and then provides a summary of the map 
statistics. The tool requires only a full cryo-EM map (in CCP4, MRC, or 
other related format). However, you can obtain additional information by 
inputting a file of two half-maps, an atomic model (in PDB or mmCIF format), 
or an atomic model and two-half maps.

**Common issues**

Program stops: All input maps are expected to be on the same grid. Also,
box information (e.g., unit cell of CRYST1 record in PDB files) must match 
across all of the inputs. 


**Related programs and Documentation**

-  `phenix.show\_map\_info <../reference/show_map_info.html>`__: 
   This program lists the properties of a map, including the origin, grid points, 
   unit cell, and map size. 

-  `phenix.map\_box <../reference/map_box.html>`__: 
   This program cuts out a box around selected atoms from a larger map 
   (MTZ, CCP4, or X-plor format).

-  `phenix.map\_symmetry <../reference/map_symmetry.html>`__: 
   Some molecules (e.g., viruses) have high internal symmetry, so you can
   reduce the map to the repeating unit. This program finds such symmetries, and
   *phenix.map_box* can extract the unique part of the map (using the extract-unique
   option). 

-  `phenix.combine\_focused\_maps <../reference/combine_focused_maps.html>`__:
   This program creates a weighted composite map from a set of locally focused maps 
   and associated models, where each part of each map is weighted by its 
   correlation with the corresponding model.
