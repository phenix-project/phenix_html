Map manipulations (cryo-EM)
===========================

**Why**

For crystallography, maps are improved by manipulating the phase information,
while the diffraction intensities (or amplitudes) remain unchanged. In contrast,
cryo-EM maps are improved by methods such as sharpening and blurring, which
typically modify the amplitudes of Fourier coefficients and leave the phases
unchanged. 

Cryo-EM maps can appear smooth and can lack a high level of detail (contrast) 
because high-resolution amplitudes of corresponding Fourier map coefficients
decay from causes such as radiation damage, sample movement, sample heterogeneity,
and errors in the reconstruction procedure. However, sharpening can reveal the 
high-resolution details concealed in the cryo-EM map.

Density modification can also be used to adjust the Fourier coefficients
to better agree with both the original map and the expected features. This
improvement relies on two ideas: (1) the Fourier coefficients representing the
map are uncorrelated, and (2) some features in a map region are known in advance.


**How**

The program *phenix.auto_sharpen* performs map sharpening by optimizing the detail and 
connectivity of a cryo-EM map. It tests several resolution-dependent functions 
and outputs the one with maximal clarity, based on kurtosis (default) or adjusted 
surface area criteria. The program works best on maps with 4.5 Å or better resolution. 
At lower resolutions, it may be unable to distinguish variations in the quality of 
the map as the sharpening is varied. Typically, optimal sharpening is determined by 
examining a box cut out of the map, and then applied to the entire map; however, 
other options are available. 

The program *phenix.combine_focused_maps* creates a weighted composition map from a set 
of locally focused maps and associated models, where each part of each map is weighted 
by its correlation with the corresponding model. The maps do not have to be
superimposed or even have the same gridding or size. 

The program *phenix.resolve_cryo_em* performs density modification of cryo-EM
map using two unmasked half-maps, the FSC-based resolution, and a sequence file specifying the
contents of the map. You can also supply a model, which will be randomized, refined, and
used in model-based density modification. You normally access the program's functionality 
by running the ResolveCryoEM tool in the Phenix GUI.

**Common issues**

- *phenix.auto_sharpen* doesn't work for *map_box*-produced maps: *auto_sharpen* should 
  not be used on maps produced with the exact-unique option of *map_box*. These maps are 
  closely masked around the density of a single molecular, so much of the map is 
  set to zero. Therefore, the map is missing noise information and *auto-sharpen*
  doesn't work properly. 

- *phenix.combine_focused_maps* doesn't work well: If the density of some of your maps is poor, 
  the rigid-body refinement step used to place a model in the maps may not work well.
  In this case, try refining the models (e.g., using *phenix.real_space_refine*??) 
  before using *combine_focused_maps*.  

- *phenix.resolve_cryo_em* doesn't work well: Poor results could be due to using 
  masked half-maps, having non-uniform solvent noise, or getting interference from
  having very prominent density away from the macromolecule. The program can also
  crash if you have limited memory and are using multiple processors. See 
  `phenix.resolve\_cryo\_em <../reference/resolve_cryo_em.html>`__ for ways to 
  address these issues.

  in a map, allowing the map to be reduced to the repeating unit.  

- `phenix.map\_box <../reference/map_box.html>`__: This tool cuts out a box from a 
  larger map. It is used to extract the unique part of a map. 

- `phenix.real\_space\_refine <../reference/real_space_refine.html>`__: This algorithm uses a 
  simplified refinement target function that speeds up calculations, so optimal data-restraint 
  weights can be identified with little runtime cost. The procedure is robust, working at 
  resolutions from 1 to 6 Å.
