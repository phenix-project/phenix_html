Experimental Phasing
====================

**Why**

One of the biggest problems in crystallography is the phase problem.
We measure amplitudes for structure factors, but cannot directly measure
the phases. Unfortunately, these phases are necessary to generate the
electron density of the molecules in the crystal. 

Phases can be determined by experimental phasing, which relies on a few 
atoms in the macromolecule with known special properties, such as a 
large number of electrons and/or anomalous scattering. These properties 
are exploited to determine the location of the special atoms (substructure), 
and then knowledge of the substructure in one or more crystals is used to 
deduce phase information for the entire macromolecule. Thus, experimental 
phasing solves the phase problem by using the differences in amplitudes from
different diffraction experiments to determine the structure factor
phases. In modern crystallography, it is most common to use single or
multiple anomalous diffraction experiments (SAD/MAD).

**How**

In Phenix, the primary program for performing experimental phasing is
*phenix.autosol*. This is a comprehensive, automatic tool that performs 
experimental phasing with the MAD, MIR, SIR, or SAD methods. The program 
locates the substructure, estimates phases, performs density modification, 
identifies noncrystallographic symmetry, and builds and refines a preliminary 
model. 

To run *phenix.autosol*, you need to provide diffraction data, typically 
one or more anomalous data sets, or a native data set plus one or more 
derivative data sets (if you are performing SIR/MIR phasing). You also 
need to provide the sequence of your macromolecule, and information about 
the anomalous scatterers and/or heavy atoms. The *phenix.autosol* results
include a PDB file containing the anomalous scatterers, an MTZ file containing the
experimentally determined phases, the optimized phases from density
modification, and, if the maps are of sufficient quality, a PDB file with
an atomic model.

**Common issues**

-  Anomalous substructure not determined: There can be several reasons
   for this. Likely candidates are a lack of anomalous signal or
   an incorrect space group assignment. Use 
   `phenix.xtriage <../reference/xtriage.html>`__ to estimate the
   resolution of the data for anomalous substructure determination. If
   this resolution is very low, it might not be possible to locate the
   substructure (note, the experimental sigmas are used in this
   calculation so it is important that these are well estimated). If
   there is uncertainty about the space group, it might be necessary to
   try the alternatives.
-  An interpretable model isn't built: The most likely reason is that
   the electron density map is of insufficient quality to be
   automatically interpreted.

**Related programs**

-  `phenix.plan\_sad\_experiment <../reference/plan_sad_experiment.html>`__: 
   This tool allows you to plan your SAD data
   collection strategy by estimating the anomalous signal and the probability 
   of solving your structure with SAD based on the anomalously-scattering atoms, 
   wavelength, size of your molecule, and overall I/sigI for your dataset.
-  `phenix.scale\_and\_merge <../reference/scale_and_merge.html>`__: This 
   tool scales any number of datasets together to
   obtain a merged, scaled anomalous dataset.  It also produces two
   half-datasets of scaled anomalous data that can be used by 
   `phenix.anomalous\_signal <../reference/anomalous_signal.html>`__
   to accurately evaluate the anomalous signal in your data.
-  `phenix.anomalous\_signal <../reference/anomalous_signal.html>`__: 
   This tool is like
   `phenix.plan\_sad\_experiment <../reference/plan_sad_experiment.html>`__
   except that it uses your measured data to give much more accurate
   estimates. Specifically, it uses your scaled data, two half-dataset files 
   of your scaled data, the name of the anomalously-scattering atom, and the 
   number of sites in the substructure in order to estimate the 
   anomalous signal in your data and the probability of solving your structure 
   by SAD. You can create the necessary scaled half-datasets using 
   `phenix.scale\_and\_merge <../reference/scale_and_merge.html>`__.
-  `phenix.hyss <../reference/hyss.html>`__: This hybrid substructure search 
   program is used by *phenix.autosol* to locate the anomalous substructure or 
   heavy atoms. It is possible to run this program separately (for anomalous data
   only) if you want to only find the substructure. In general, it is
   recommended to use *phenix.autosol* for this as it makes optimal use
   of *phenix.hyss* to locate sites.
-  `Phaser EP <../reference/phaser_ep.html>`__: *Phaser* can directly perform SAD 
   phasing, given an initial anomalous substructure. Phases can be calculated 
   for the substructure's given hand (enantiomer) or both hands. *Phaser* attempts 
   to complete the substructure automatically. Note, *Phaser* can also combine 
   information from a molecular replacement solution in the phase calculation 
   process (in MR-SAD mode).
-  `phenix.emma <../reference/emma.html>`__: This Euclidian model matching 
   program can compare different substructure solutions by superimposing sites
   taking into account crystallographic symmetry, possible origin
   shifts, and polar axes. This can be useful if comparing solutions
   from different programs.
