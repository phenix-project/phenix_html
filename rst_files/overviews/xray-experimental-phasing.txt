Experimental Phasing
====================

**Why**

One of the biggest problems in crystallography is the phase problem.
We measure amplitudes for structure factors, but cannot directly measure
the phases. Unfortunately, these phases are necessary to generate the
electron density of the molecules in the crystal. Experimental phasing
solves the phase problem by using the differences in amplitudes from
different diffraction experiments to determine the structure factor
phases. In modern crystallography it is most common to use single or
multiple anomalous diffraction experiments (SAD/MAD).

**How**

In Phenix the primary program for performing experimental phasing is
phenix.autosol. This is a powerful tool that goes through the steps of
anomalous substructure location, phasing, phase improvement, and initial
model building. To run phenix.autosol you will need to provide
diffraction data, typically one or more anomalous data sets, or a native
data set plus one or more derivative data sets (if you are performing
SIR/MIR phasing). You will also need to provide the sequence of your
macromolecule, and information about the anomalous scatterers and/or
heavy atoms. The results from phenix.autosol will include a PDB
containing the anomalous scatterers, an MTZ file containing the
experimentally determined phases, and the optimized phases from density
modification, and, if the maps are of sufficient quality a PDB file with
an atomic model.

**Common issues**

-  Anomalous substructure not determined: there can be several reasons
   for this. Likely candidates are a lack of anomalous signal, or
   incorrect space group assignment. Use phenix.xtriage to estimate the
   resolution of the data for anomalous substructure determination. If
   this is very low resolution it might not be possible to locate the
   substructure (note that the experimental sigmas are used in this
   calculation so it is important that these are well estimated). If
   there is uncertainty about the space group it might be necessary to
   try the alternatives.
-  An interpretable model isn't built: the most likely reason is that
   the electron density map is of insufficient quality to be
   automatically interpreted.

**Related programs**

-  `phenix.hyss <../reference/hyss.htm>`__:This program is used by
   phenix.autosol to locate the anomalous substructure or heavy atoms.
   It is possible to run this program separately (for anomalous data
   only) if you want to only find the substructure. In general it is
   recommended to use phenix.autosol for this as it makes optimal use of
   phenix.hyss to locate sites.
-  `phenix.emma <../reference/emma.htm>`__:This program can be used to
   compare different substructure solution, by superimposing sites
   taking into account crystallographic symmetry, possible origin
   shifts, and polar axes. This can be useful if comparing solutions
   from different programs.
