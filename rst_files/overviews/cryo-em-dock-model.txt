Docking a model into a map
==========================

**Why**

Obtaining the structure of a macromolecule generally requires building 
an atomic model that fits the cryo-EM map. A docking procedure is used 
to do this fitting if the model, or a part of the model, is known but has 
not been placed into the map. 

For example, your cryo-EM map might show a molecular complex assembled from
components available from other experiments, such as X-ray crystallography. 
Then, you can dock these components' models into your cryo-EM map to obtain
a model for the entire complex.

**How**

The program *phenix.dock_in_map* automatically docks one or several models into a map, 
using a convolution-based shape search to find a part of the map that is similar 
to the model. Initially, it performs a low-resolution search that focuses on 
the overall shape of the molecule, which is performed without rotation to 
optimize runtime. Alternatively, you can perform an initial fast search by 
matching the moments of inertia of the model and map, but this option requires
an accurate map that looks a lot like the model. Next, if the placement is 
satisfactory, a full search can be run on multiple processors using real-space
rigid-body refinement with the full resolution of the map. 

In a standard run of *phenix.dock_in_map*, you input the model (PDB file) that you 
want to place, a map (CCP4, MRC, or other map format file), the nominal resolution
of the map, and the number of processors to use.The program outputs a search
PDB file transformed to superpose on the target map file
