Structure Refinement
====================

**Why**

Once an atomic model has been built into an electron density map, or
obtained by molecular replacement, you need to optimize it to best fit
the experimental data while also preserving good agreement with prior
chemical knowledge.

For x-ray crystallographic data, this refinement process is usually done
in reciprocal space. Using a least-squares or maximum-likelihood target,
the model parameters are changed so the model-driven structure factors 
match the amplitudes or intensities of the experimental structure factors. 
For example, these model parameters can include (a) atomic parameters, such as 
coordinates, atomic displacement parameters, occupancies, and scattering 
fractions, and (b) non-atomic parameters that describe contributions from 
bulk solvent, twinning, and crystal anisotropy. 


**How**

In Phenix, the primary program for refining atomic models is
*phenix.refine*. This applies optimization algorithms (minimization or
simulated annealing) to change the model parameters (typically
coordinates and atomic displacement parameters) to improve the fit of
the model to the data. At the same time, it applies restraints to prior 
chemical information (such as bond lengths, angles, and torsions) to 
maintain good stereochemistry. This customizable program allows multiple 
refinement strategies to be combined and applied to any selected part of 
the model in a single run.

**Related programs**

-  `phenix.rosetta\_refine <../reference/rosetta_refine.html>`__: This
   program combines crystallographic structure refinement algorithms
   from Phenix with physically realistic potentials for model
   optimization from Rosetta. The tool is useful at low resolution, 
   where it combines a wide radius of convergence across distinct local minima 
   with realistic geometry.
-  `phenix.ensemble\_refinement <../reference/ensemble_refinement.html>`__: This
   program combines crystallographic refinement with molecular dynamics to
   produce  ensemble models fitted to diffraction data. These
   ensemble models can contain ~50-500 individual structures, and can
   simultaneously account for anisotopic and anharmonic atomic
   distributions.
-  `ERRASER <../reference/erraser.html>`__: This is another Rosetta method that
   performs real-space rebuilding of RNA structures for improved geometry and
   fit to data.
