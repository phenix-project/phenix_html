Structure Refinement
====================

**Why**

Once an atomic model has been built into an electron density map, or
obtained by molecular replacement, it needs to be optimized to best fit
the experimental data while also preserving good agreement with prior
chemical knowledge. This process is typically iterated with manual model
rebuilding, making use of improved electron density maps, created by
including phase information from the current atomic model.

**How**

The primary program for refinement of atomic models in Phenix is
phenix.refine. This applies optimization algorithms (minimization or
simulated annealing) to change the parameters of the model, typically
coordinates and atomic displacement parameters, to improve the fit of
the model to the data. At the same time restraints to prior chemical
information, e.g. bond lengths, angles, torsions, are also applied in
order to maintain good stereochemistry.

**Related programs**

-  `phenix.rosetta\_refine <../reference/rosetta_refine.htm>`__:This
   program combines crystallographic structure refinement algorithms
   from Phenix with physically realistic potentials for model
   optimization from Rosetta. This is intended for use in difficult
   cases, especially at low resolution where it combines a wide radius
   of convergence to the correct structure with excellent geometry.
-  `phenix.ensemble\_refinement <../reference/ensemble_refinement.htm>`__:This
   program uses molecular dynamics as a mechanism to generate
   conformations of molecules in the crystal. A time averaging method is
   used to generate ensemble models fitted to diffraction data. These
   ensemble models can contain ~50-500 individual structures and
   simultaneously account for anisotopic and anharmonic atomic
   distributions.
