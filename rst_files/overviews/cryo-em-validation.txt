Validation (cryo-EM)
====================

**Why**

There is a long path from the initial idea about a molecule to 
the final atomic model and its interpretation. This path comprises many steps stretched
over time, including obtaining samples, acquiring data, analyzing the data,
building an atomic model, and refining the model to better represent the data. 
Errors can occur in each of these steps, so validation procedures should be 
implemented in each of them. 

In particular, validation addresses data, model, and model-versus-data quality:

- Data. The quality of experimental data, such as the resolution or amount 
  of noise, defines the quality of the derived models. Therefore, it is vital to 
  understand the data quality so that you use the correct model building and 
  refinement procedures appropriate for the data at hand.
  (See the `Assessing Map Quality (cryo-EM) <../overviews/cryo-em-map-quality.html>`__ 
  overview for more details.)

- Model. The underlying principles behind model validation are the same for 
  any experimental method: a good model should make chemical sense and be consistent 
  with empirical statistics for high-quality prior structures. Thus, atomic models 
  derived from cryo-EM reconstructions should conform to prior knowledge about  
  covalent geometry, non-bonded interactions, and known distributions of 
  side-chain and main-chain conformations in both proteins and nucleic acids. 

- Model-versus-data fit. Model-verses-data validation criteria depend on the type
  of experimental data and require the model to describe its own data well. A 
  perfectly good model from a stereochemistry perspective may not fit the 3D 
  reconstruction sufficiently or at all. Generally, the goal is to have as few 
  outliers as is feasible, where outliers can be explained by their environment
  and/or experimental data. In reciprocal space, model-versus-data agreement is 
  assessed by curves of the Fourier shell correlation (FSC) as a function of resolution. 

**How**

`Comprehensive validation (cryo-EM)` is a one-stop program in Phenix that
validates model, data, and model-versus-data fit. The minimal input is a 
map (in MRC, CCP4, or related format) and an atomic model (in PDB or mmCIF format). 
However, providing a map, model, and two half-maps is desirable.

For geometric validation, Phenix uses *MolProbity*, which is fully integrated into
the `Comprehensive validation (cryo-EM)` package. The graphics programs *Coot* and 
*PyMOL* are also fully integrated, enabling communication of the validation results.

**Common issues**

- Outliers versus errors: In most structures, there will be Ramachandran and 
  side-chain rotamer outliers. If the data (the map) and surrounding chemistry 
  supports the outlier conformation, then it is most likely an outlier from prior 
  expectations. In the absence of supporting density and/or conflicting local chemistry, 
  it is probably an error that needs correction. For example, an atomic model 
  derived from low-resolution data is expected to have no geometrical outliers 
  because they are unlikely to be supported by the experimental data.

**Related programs**

- `phenix.cablam\_validation <../reference/cablam_validation.html>`__: The C-Alpha 
  Based Low-Resolution Annotation Method (CaBLAM) validates protein backbone 
  conformations in models determined at low resolution (2.5-4 Ã…), where it is difficult
  to determine peptide orientations because carbonyl O atoms cannot be discerned in 
  the density maps. The program uses protein C-alpha geometry to evaluate the main-chain 
  geometry and identify areas of probable secondary structure.
 
- `phenix.emringer <../reference/emringer.html>`__: This program provides an EMRinger score, 
  which quantifies how well the model backbone places side chains in density peaks that are consistent 
  with rotameric conformations. 
  ** I don't see this in the rst reference folder**

- `phenix.mtriage <../reference/mtriage.html>`__: This program computes various 
  cryo-EM map statistics, including resolution estimates, Fourier shell correlation 
  curves, and more. 

** Cut these last two? They were listed as 2 of 3 command line programs that were 
main drivers of the comprehensive validation tool. But I don't see the files/pages. **

- **phenix.model_statistics:** This program computes covalent model geometry statistics, 
  as well as various *MolProbity* scores (Clashscore, rotamer and Ramachandran plot,
  C-beta deviation, and much more), ADP (B-factor), and occupancy statistics.
  ** Does this program still exist? Still relevant? **

- **phenix.map_model_cc:** This program computes various model-map
  correlation coefficients, such as the overall CC, CC per each chain, and CC per each
  residue.
  ** Is this supposed to be map_to_model? **
