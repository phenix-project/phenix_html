Validation (cryo-EM)
====================

**Why**

Many steps are involved to get from the initial idea about a molecule to
the final atomic model and its interpretation. Errors can occur in each of
these steps, so validation procedures are necessary to ensure that the
atomic models are sensical and fit the experimental data.

In particular, validation addresses data, model, and model-versus-data quality:

- Data. The quality of experimental data, such as the resolution or amount 
  of noise, defines the quality of the derived models. Therefore, it is vital to 
  understand the data quality so that you use the correct model building and 
  refinement procedures appropriate for the data at hand.
  (See the `Assessing Map Quality (cryo-EM) <../overviews/cryo-em-map-quality.html>`__ 
  overview for more details.)

- Model. The underlying principles behind model validation are the same for 
  any experimental method: a good model should make chemical sense and be consistent 
  with empirical statistics for high-quality prior structures. Thus, atomic models 
  derived from cryo-EM reconstructions should conform to prior knowledge about  
  covalent geometry, non-bonded interactions, and known distributions of 
  side-chain and main-chain conformations in both proteins and nucleic acids. 
  Generally, the goal is to have as few
  outliers as is feasible, where outliers can be explained by their environment
  and/or experimental data.

- Model-versus-data fit. Model-verses-data validation criteria require the model
  to describe its own data well. A perfectly good model from a stereochemistry
  perspective may not fit the 3D
  reconstruction sufficiently or at all.  In reciprocal space, model-versus-data agreement is
  assessed by curves of the Fourier shell correlation (FSC) as a function of resolution. In
  real space, the agreement is measured by correlation coefficients (CCs).

**How**

`Comprehensive validation (cryo-EM)` is a one-stop program in Phenix that
validates model, data, and model-versus-data fit. The minimal input is a 
map (in MRC, CCP4, or related format) and an atomic model (in PDB or mmCIF format). 
However, providing a map, model, and two half-maps is desirable.

For geometric validation, Phenix uses *MolProbity*, which is fully integrated into
the `Comprehensive validation (cryo-EM)` package. The graphics programs *Coot* and 
*PyMOL* are also fully integrated, enabling communication of the validation results.

**Common issues**

- Outliers versus errors: In most structures, there will be Ramachandran and 
  side-chain rotamer outliers. If the data (the map) and surrounding chemistry 
  supports the outlier conformation, then it is most likely an outlier from prior 
  expectations. In the absence of supporting density and/or conflicting local chemistry, 
  it is probably an error that needs correction. For example, an atomic model 
  derived from low-resolution data is expected to have no geometrical outliers 
  because they are unlikely to be supported by the experimental data.

  Based Low-Resolution Annotation Method (CaBLAM) validates protein backbone 
  conformations in models determined at low resolution (2.5-4 Ã…), where it is difficult
  to determine peptide orientations because carbonyl O atoms cannot be discerned in 
  the density maps. The program uses protein C-alpha geometry to evaluate the main-chain 
  geometry and identify areas of probable secondary structure.

  cryo-EM map statistics, including resolution estimates, Fourier shell correlation 
  curves, and more.
