Model Building
==============

**Why**

Determining the structure of a macromolecule typically requires 
building an atomic model by fitting to maps obtained from 
`experimental phasing <xray-experimental-phasing.html>`__ or
`molecular replacement <xray-molecular-replacement.html>`__. 
For many cases, automated methods can be used to build models for
both proteins and nucleic acids. 

The accuracy and completeness of the model
building is a function of the quality of the starting electron density
map, and less critically the resolution of the data. At low resolution
(3.0 Å or worse), partial models are usually built, which require manual
completion.

**How**

In Phenix, several programs aid in automated model building; the main one 
is *phenix.autobuild*. The model building process integrates phase improvement 
using density modification methods with automated map interpretation in order 
to build and refine models. This minimally requires an experimental density map, 
experimental diffraction data, and the sequence of the molecule(s) in the crystal.
The program outputs a model file with the automatically built model and the map
coefficients for the best electron density map created during the
model building process.

**Related programs**

-  `phenix.find\_helices\_strands <../reference/find_helices_strands.html>`__: This
   program very rapidly locates protein secondary structure elements in an electron 
   density map. This is extremely useful for quickly confirming that a map contains 
   macromolecular features, or for interpreting low-resolution (4 Å or worse) maps. 
   Optionally, you can provide the amino acid sequence and the program will fit residues
   where density permits.
-  `phenix.fit\_loops <../reference/fit_loops.html>`__: This program docks missing
   loops into protein structures given the current incomplete model, the
   sequence, and an electron density map. Model building procedures are
   sometimes unable to fit models to poor density in loop regions,
   especially in the initial stages of map interpretation. As the model
   becomes more complete and maps improve, *phenix.fit\_loops* can perform
   simple real-space refinement to clean up the structure. 
-  `phenix.map\_to\_model <../reference/map_to_model.html>`__: This program is 
   designed for lower-resolution model building. It is suitable for
   both crystallographic maps and cryo-EM maps.  Taking into account
   symmetry used to create a map, it builds only the unique
   part of the model and expands to the remaining NCS-related copies.
