Density Modification
====================

**Why**

The crystallographic phase problem can be solved using experimental
phasing or molecular replacement. In both cases, these initial phases may
be inaccurate due to experimental errors, low signal-to-noise, or
model bias. Therefore, it is usually necessary to improve the phases
by exploiting our prior knowledge about electron density distributions
in the crystal. In the case of single wavelength (SAD) or single derivative 
(SIR) data, this step in essential for resolving the inherent phase 
ambiguity in these experiments. 

The phase improvement procedure is usually referred to as density modification 
because new phase estimates are obtained by modifying the electron 
density to conform to prior expectations. For example, methods to improve
phases include solvent flattening, histogram matching, and non-crystallographic
symmetry averaging (if NCS is present). The result of the procedure 
should be a better set of phases, which can be used to make a map for 
interpretation (i.e., model building).
 

**How**

In Phenix, several programs carry out density modification (see Related programs 
below). Density modification can be performed using either a set of experimental 
phases (i.e., Hendrickson-Lattmann coefficients), or experimental amplitudes 
and an atomic model (from which the phases are calculated). The density 
modification program will try to automatically determine solvent content 
and non-crystallographic relationships between regions of density.

**Related programs**

- `phenix.density\_modification <../reference/density_modification.html>`__: This 
  program performs iterative phase improvement with Resolve density modification,
  including the use of non-crystallographic symmetry and electron-density distributions.
- `phenix.multi\_crystal\_average <../reference/multi_crystal_average.html>`__: This 
  program improves phases interactively and averages electron density, both 
  within a crystal and between crystals. This very powerful technique can 
  generate high quality phases in some circumstances.
- `phenix.ncs\_average <../reference/ncs_average.html>`__: This program averages 
  the electron density for molecules related by non-crystallographic symmetry. No
  iterative phase improvement is performed, just a single round of
  averaging.  This is useful for improving signal-to-noise in maps for
  model building.
