Map Symmetry (cryo-EM)
===============================

**Why**

Some molecules, such as viruses, have high internal symmetry so you
can reduce the cryo-EM map to the repeating unit. This can decrease the 
required computational resources and enable better averaging for improved 
signal to noise. 
 

**How**

The *phenix.map_symmetry* program uses the density at a set of randomly-chosen
points in a cryo-EM map to identify symmetries, which are selected from a set of 
pre-defined symmetry types (e.g., point-group symmetry and helical symmetry). 
The tool then creates a file with the symmetry operations. 

By default, *phenix.map_symmetry* assumes the principle axes of symmetry in a 
map are along x, y, and z and that the helical symmetry is along z. The user can
specify a specific symmetry type or look for all elements in the database of
45 common symmetry elements and point groups.

**Common issues**

None. 


**Related programs and Documentation**

-  `phenix.map\_box <../reference/map_box.html>`__: 
   This program cuts out a box around selected atoms from a larger map 
   (MTZ, CCP4, or X-plor format). It can be used to extract the unique
   part of the map (using the extract-unique option). 

-  `phenix.combine\_focused\_maps <../reference/combine_focused_maps.html>`__:
   This program creates a weighted composite map from a set of locally focused maps 
   and associated models, where each part of each map is weighted by its 
   correlation with the corresponding model.
