Real-space refinement (cryo-EM)
===============================

**Why**

Once an atomic model has been built using a cryo-EM map, you need to 
optimize it to best fit
the experimental data while also preserving good agreement with prior
chemical knowledge. This process alternates between automated refinement,
validation, and either manual or automated model corrections. 

A target function guides the refinement by linking the model parameters 
to the experimental data and by scoring the model-versus-data fit. 
For cryo-EM data, refinement of the model is done in real space and the
target function is formulated in terms of a three-dimensional map. 
Because there are generally too many model parameters, refinement 
requires additional restraints that modify the target function by 
creating relationships between independent parameters. 


**How**

The program used to refine atomic models in real space is 
*phenix.real_space_refine*. The algorithm uses a simplified refinement
target function that speeds up calculations, so optimal data-restraint 
weights can be identified with little runtime cost. The procedure is
robust, working at resolutions from 1 to 6 Å. The input and output models
can be in PDB or mmCIF formats. The input map can be in CCP4 or MTZ format. 

This program makes use of restraints on covalent geometry, secondary 
structure, Ramachandran plots, rotamer outliers, and internal molecular
symmetry. The default mode performs gradient-driven minimization of the 
entire model. However, optimization can also be performed using simulated 
annealing, morphing, rigid-body refinement, and/or systematic side-chain 
improvement — at the potential expense of longer runtimes.

**Common issues**

- Poorly refined model: If you use secondary structure restraints, an incorrectly
  refined model is likely if there are errors in the secondary structure 
  annotation (e.g., incorrect SHEET and HELIX records in the PDB file header).
  Secondary structure annotation strongly depends on the quality of the input 
  model.
