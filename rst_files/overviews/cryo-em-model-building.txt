Automated model building (cryo-EM)
==================================

**Why**

Determining the structure of a macromolecule typically requires 
building an atomic model that fits the cryo-EM map. If the structure 
of the molecule or its components are unknown, the model has to 
be built from scratch into the cryo-EM map. This task is challenging 
because molecules are typically very large and chain tracing is difficult
at low resolution. Therefore, manual interpretation of cryo-EM maps is 
time-consuming and error-prone. For many cases, however, automated methods 
can be used to build models for both proteins and nucleic acids.

After an atomic model is generated, it is real-space refined using 
secondary-structure restraints (e.g., see *phenix.real_space_refine*). 

**How**

The program *phenix.map_to_model* interprets a cryo-EM map and automatically 
builds an atomic model. First, the map is sharpened using *phenix.auto_sharpen.*
The unique parts of the structure are then identified by taking the 
reconstruction symmetry into account. In addition, the procedure identifies 
which parts of the map correspond to protein or RNA/DNA. To save runtime, you
can use *phenix.auto_sharpen* to sharpen the map and *phenix.map_box* to cut out
the unique part before you run *phenix.map_to_model.* 

The *phenix.map_to_model* tool requires you to input a cryo-EM map with CCP4-style 
(MRC, etc) or MTZ map coefficients and a sequence file. For optimal model-building 
results, the resolution of the map should be 4.5 Ã… or better. The program outputs
a PDB file with the resulting PDB map that is superimposed on the original map.

**Common issues**

- One or more sub-processes crash: If you have a very large structure, your
  computer may not have enough memory to run *phenix.map_to_model*. The easiest
  solution is to run the tool on just the unique part of the structure. You can
  also cut out boxes and work on each section individually. Or your can cut back 
  on the resolution to save memory.

- Want to re-run without all the steps: Partially-completed jobs can occur when 
  your queueing system crashes during a run or one or more sub-processes crash. 
  If you have a partially-completed or completed run, you can carry on from where 
  you left off by using the keyword carry_on=True. You can also use this keyword 
  to build up your model in pieces or to run many jobs in parallel. 


**Related programs**

-  `phenix.auto\_sharpen <../reference/auto_sharpen.html>`__: This
   program performs map sharpening by optimizing the detail and connectivity
   of a cryo-EM map. 

-  `phenix.map\_box <../reference/map_box.html>`__: 
   This program cuts out a box around selected atoms from a larger map 
   (MTZ, CCP4, or X-plor format).

-  `phenix.fix\_insertions\_deletions <../reference/fix_insertions_deletions.html>`__: 
   This program fixes register errors in the model by comparing the density of 
   side-chain positions to a sequence file. 

-  `phenix.trace\_and\_build <../reference/trace_and_build.html>`__: This tool 
   rapidly builds protein models by tracing the path of a polypeptide chain, finding
   the CB positions, and building the atomic model. Normally, this is done by running
   *phenix.map_to_model,* but you can also run *phenix.trace_and_build* directly.
