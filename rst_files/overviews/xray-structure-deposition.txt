Crystallographic Structure Deposition
=====================================

**Background**

Once a crystallographic structure is solved, it is usually deposited
in the Worldwide Protein Data Bank (wwPDB). This is necessary for
publication as most journals require a PDB ID to be included in any
manuscript that describes a new crystallographic structure.
The wwPDB is an invaluable resource that contains over 190,000 structures
(as of July 2021).

**Procedure**

The model files (PDB and mmCIF) generated by *phenix.refine* contain the information
required when depositing a structure to the wwPDB. However, the wwPDB currently only 
accepts the mmCIF (i.e., PDBx/mmCIF) model files for deposition.

To generate a model file suitable for deposition, we recommend a two-stage process:

#. By default, *phenix.refine* will output model files in mmCIF and PDB format.
   If you turned off the option for mmCIF output, run a final cycle of
   *phenix.refine* that writes mmCIF files for model and data. This can be set in
   the Output section of the GUI.

#. You can then process the model file (mmCIF) and a sequence file with
   *mmtbx.prepare\_pdb\_deposition* to create a mmCIF file with the sequence.
   This program requires the full sequence for the macromolecule to be provided.
   In the GUI, this program is in the "PDB Deposition" section of tools.

**Related programs**

-  `phenix.get_pdb_validation_report <../reference/get_pdb_validation_report.html>`__:
   This program submits your model and data in CIF format to the PDB OneDep
   server to get a validation report in PDF and XML formats.
-  `phenix.table\_one <../reference/table_one.html>`__: This program generates the  
   table of crystallographic statistics required by most scientific journals.
