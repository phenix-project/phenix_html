Ligands
=======

**Why**

The goal of a crystallographic study is often to visualize the
interaction of a small molecule or ligand with a macromolecule. This is
a core process in the development of new therapeutics. It is also 
common to discover density for an unanticipated small molecule in
complex with a protein while solving a structure. In both cases, 
you need to fit the small molecule into the electron density
to complete the atomic model. As part of this process, you frequently
need to generate appropriate stereochemical restraints for new ligands for
use in structure refinement.

**How**

In Phenix, the principal tool for fitting ligands into electron density is
phenix.ligand\_fit. This identifies unfilled electron density in a map
and attempts to place the user-defined ligand in the density by rotating
around any torsional degrees of freedom. The process requires an
electron density map, coordinates for the macromolecule, and information
about the ligand (either as coordinates or as a chemical description that
can be used to generate coordinates). The program outputs the coordinates of
the fit ligand. 

After ligand(s) are fit, subsequent refinement steps will require stereochemical 
restraints. In some cases, these may be present in the default restraint libraries. 
However, you often need to generate new restraints. The phenix.elbow (eLBOW) program
automatically generates geometry restraints for novel ligands or improves 
restraints for standard ligands, starting from a variety of different formats.

**Related programs**

-  `phenix.guided\_ligand\_replacement <../reference/guided_ligand_replacement.html>`__: This
   program uses prior knowledge from a previously fit ligand to expedite
   the fitting of a similar ligand into the same or similar protein.
   This is very useful when studying a series of compounds for the same
   or related macromolecular targets.
-  `phenix.ligand\_identification <../reference/ligand_identification.html>`__: This
   program determines the identity of an unknown ligand by analyzing difference 
   density peaks to reveal which ligand is likely to be present. Using a 
   library of the 180 most frequently observed ligands in the PDB, the tool ranks 
   each molecule by density fit and chemical interaction with the macromolecule.
-  `phenix.ligand\_pipeline <../reference/ligand_pipeline.html>`__: This
   program generates a near-finished structure of a protein-ligand 
   complex starting from a current protein model,
   diffraction data, and information about ligands. It combines Xtriage,
   Phaser, eLBOW, phenix.refine, AutoBuild, and LigandFit with optional
   interaction with Coot. It can significantly reduce the manual effort
   required for more difficult structures.
-  `phenix.ready\_set <../reference/ready_set.html>`__: This program prepares a 
   model for refinement by generating all necessary ligand restraints with eLBOW and 
   then updating the model file to reflect atom name changes from the new restraints.
-  `phenix.reel <../reference/reel.html>`__: This Restraints Editor Especially Ligands (REEL)
   tool includes a 3D view of the ligand and a tabular view of the restraints, allowing
   target values and standard deviations to be easily edited.
