Model Validation
================

**Why**

The atomic models generated from crystallographic experiments should
conform to prior knowledge about stereochemistry. This covers a wide
range of information, ranging from covalent geometry, through non-bonded
interactions, up to known distributions of side chain and main chain
conformations in both proteins and nucleic acids. Validation is required
to check the consistency of an atomic model with this prior knowledge to
identify possible errors in the model. Validation also extends beyond
purely geometric measures to include local fit to electron density.

**How**

The main tool for geometric validation in Phenix is MolProbity. This
is tightly integrated with structure refinement such that after running
phenix.refine in the GUI a complete set of validation statistics are
produced. In combination with the Coot program for visualization of
models and electron density it is possible to rapidly check vaidation
outliers and make corrections. Validation metrics for local fit to
density are also provided in the form of a multi-criterion plot.

**Common issues**

-  Outliers versus errors: in most structures there will be a non-zero
   number of Ramachandran and side chain rotamer outliers. If the
   electron density, and surrounding chemistry, supports the outlier
   conformation then it is most probable that this is correct (i.e. an
   outlier from prior expectations, rather than an error). However, in
   the absence of supporting density, and/or conflicting local
   chemistry, it is most probably an error that needs correction.
