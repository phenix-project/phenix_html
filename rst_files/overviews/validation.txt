Model Validation
================

**Why** 

You should validate an atomic model generated from crystallographic experiments
by checking if it is consistent with priory knowledge about stereochemistry. 
This information includes covalent geometry, non-bonded interactions, and 
known distributions of side chain and main chain conformations in both 
proteins and nucleic acids. This validation should also extend beyond purely geometric 
measures to include local fit to electron density.

Validation is performed throughout the structure solution process, which
consists of cycles of validation, manual or automated
rebuilding, and automated refinement until a satisfactory model is obtained.
Useful validation criteria depend on the resolution of the data. 

**How**

In Phenix, model validation is provided in the comprehensive validation
GUI based on the *MolProbity* tool. This software can be run as a standalone 
program or automatically as part of *phenix.refine*. Overall model statistics 
are presented in a summary chart with local scores reported as plots and as tables 
listing the outliers on each criterion. The model validation tasks are
essentially identical to the *MolProbity* web service. The validation results
are seamlessly integrated with the graphics programs *Coot* and *PyMOL*.

**Common issues**

*Outliers versus errors*: In most structures, there will Ramachandran
and side chain rotamer outliers. If the electron density and surrounding
chemistry supports the outlier conformation, then it is most likely an
outlier from prior expectations. In the absence of supporting density and/or
conflicting local chemistry, it is probably an error that needs correction.
